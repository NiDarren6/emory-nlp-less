INFO:root:prompt: You are an expert SQL engineer with 20+ years of experience. You will be given some SQL equivalence rules conditional on some database schemas. You will then be given a pair of SQL queries, consisting of a gold query and a machine-generated query, and a database schema that defines the context of the queries. 

Your task is to compare the two provided SQL queries on logical equivalence and generate one more equivalence rule in the same format as the provided example equivalence rules.

Please make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please also keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.



Evaluation Criteria:

Logical equivalence - the alignment between the gold SQL query and the machine-generated SQL query. A machine-generated SQL query is logically equivalent to the gold query if these two queries would RETURN THE SAME RESULTS AND IN THE SAME ORDER for ALL POSSIBLE DATABASE INSTANCES that satisfy the provided database schema for these queries. Annotators were asked to penalize machine-generated queries that overlooked edge cases that the gold queries would have caught otherwise.



Evaluation steps:

1. Understand the Database Schema: Identify all tables used in both queries. List all columns referenced, along with their data types and constraints. Determine primary and foreign key relationships. Note any indexes or unique constraints that may affect query execution.
2. Parse and Break Down Each Query: Identify selected columns, functions, and expressions. Note the tables involved and the join conditions. Understand the filtering conditions applied. Identify grouping and aggregate conditions, if any. Determine if result ordering affects equivalence.
3. Compare Query Components: Check if both queries use the same tables and join conditions. Compare filtering conditions in the WHERE clauses. Assess whether the same columns and expressions are selected. Identify if different functions or syntaxes achieve the same result. Look for logical equivalence in expressions and calculations.
4. Consider Edge Cases and Data Variations: Conceptualize sample datasets that include edge cases (e.g., NULL values, zero values, special characters). Analyze how each query handles these edge cases. Ensure that data type differences do not affect the outcome. Verify that constraints (e.g., NOT NULL, UNIQUE) are accounted for.
5. Evaluate Aggregations and Calculations: Confirm that aggregate functions (e.g., SUM, COUNT) are applied identically. Ensure calculations (e.g., subtraction, addition) produce the same results.
6. Check for Logical Equivalence in Conditional Expressions: Compare conditional expressions like IIF, CASE WHEN, and IF. Determine if conditions and returned values are logically the same.
7. Assess Ordering of Results: If ORDER BY clause is present, confirm that both queries order results identically. Recognize that differing order may affect equivalence if result order is significant.
8. Generate a New Logical Equivalence Rule (If Applicable): Create an "Equivalent Queries: <query1>
<query2>
Schema Conditions:<conditions>" statement that defines the equivalence. Use GENERALIZED COLUMN and TABLE NAMES. Specify any necessary conditions based on the database schema. Present the rule clearly, indicating both the equivalence and the conditions under which it holds.



Example Equivalence Rules:

<Rule>
Equivalent Queries:
SELECT c1 from t1 WHERE ...;
SELECT c1 FROM t1 WHERE ...;
Schema Conditions:
None.
</Rule>



# Guidelines:
- Make SURE complete to every step PERFECTLY without ANY Mistakes
- Follow the Rules I Gave you and Remember to AVOID generating repeated equivalence rules in the examples I gave you.
- Be sure to format your response like the example equivalence rules I gave you.
- Put <New Rule></New Rule> around the new equivalence rule that you think of. Do not use other formatting around the equivalent queries.
- Use GENERALIZED COLUMN AND TABLE NAMES in any EQUIVALENCE RULE YOU WRITE. DO NOT USE THE SAME NAMES IN THE PROVIDED QUERY PAIRS!!!!
- If the two queries are not logically equivalent, say <New Rule> Not equivalent </New Rule>.
- If the new equivalence rule is already repeated in the examples listed, say <New Rule> Rule exists </New Rule>.
- The new rule should be be MINIMAL to CLEARLY demonstrate the highlighted semantic difference. Use ellipses to shorten SQL queries where necessary to achieve this.

Take a Deep Breath and Carefully Follow the Rules, Guides and Examples I gave you. I will tip you $2000 if you do EVERYTHING Perfectly.

Your task is to compare the two provided SQL queries on logical equivalence and generate one more equivalence rule in the same format as the provided example equivalence rules.

Please make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please also keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.



Evaluation Criteria:

Logical equivalence - the alignment between the gold SQL query and the machine-generated SQL query. A machine-generated SQL query is logically equivalent to the gold query if these two queries would RETURN THE SAME RESULTS AND IN THE SAME ORDER for ALL POSSIBLE DATABASE INSTANCES that satisfy the provided database schema for these queries. Annotators were asked to penalize machine-generated queries that overlooked edge cases that the gold queries would have caught otherwise.



Evaluation steps:

1. Understand the Database Schema: Identify all tables used in both queries. List all columns referenced, along with their data types and constraints. Determine primary and foreign key relationships. Note any indexes or unique constraints that may affect query execution.
2. Parse and Break Down Each Query: Identify selected columns, functions, and expressions. Note the tables involved and the join conditions. Understand the filtering conditions applied. Identify grouping and aggregate conditions, if any. Determine if result ordering affects equivalence.
3. Compare Query Components: Check if both queries use the same tables and join conditions. Compare filtering conditions in the WHERE clauses. Assess whether the same columns and expressions are selected. Identify if different functions or syntaxes achieve the same result. Look for logical equivalence in expressions and calculations.
4. Consider Edge Cases and Data Variations: Conceptualize sample datasets that include edge cases (e.g., NULL values, zero values, special characters). Analyze how each query handles these edge cases. Ensure that data type differences do not affect the outcome. Verify that constraints (e.g., NOT NULL, UNIQUE) are accounted for.
5. Evaluate Aggregations and Calculations: Confirm that aggregate functions (e.g., SUM, COUNT) are applied identically. Ensure calculations (e.g., subtraction, addition) produce the same results.
6. Check for Logical Equivalence in Conditional Expressions: Compare conditional expressions like IIF, CASE WHEN, and IF. Determine if conditions and returned values are logically the same.
7. Assess Ordering of Results: If ORDER BY clause is present, confirm that both queries order results identically. Recognize that differing order may affect equivalence if result order is significant.
8. Generate a New Logical Equivalence Rule (If Applicable): Create an "Equivalent Queries: <query1>
<query2>
Schema Conditions:<conditions>" statement that defines the equivalence. Use GENERALIZED COLUMN and TABLE NAMES. Specify any necessary conditions based on the database schema. Present the rule clearly, indicating both the equivalence and the conditions under which it holds.



Example Equivalence Rules:

<Rule>
Equivalent Queries:
SELECT c1 from t1 WHERE ...;
SELECT c1 FROM t1 WHERE ...;
Schema Conditions:
None.
</Rule>

INFO:root:prompt: You are an expert SQL engineer with 20+ years of experience. You will be given some SQL equivalence rules conditional on some database schemas. You will then be given a pair of SQL queries, consisting of a gold query and a machine-generated query, and a database schema that defines the context of the queries. 

Your task is to compare the two provided SQL queries on logical equivalence and generate one more equivalence rule in the same format as the provided example equivalence rules.

Please make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please also keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.



Evaluation Criteria:

Logical equivalence - the alignment between the gold SQL query and the machine-generated SQL query. A machine-generated SQL query is logically equivalent to the gold query if these two queries would RETURN THE SAME RESULTS AND IN THE SAME ORDER for ALL POSSIBLE DATABASE INSTANCES that satisfy the provided database schema for these queries. Annotators were asked to penalize machine-generated queries that overlooked edge cases that the gold queries would have caught otherwise.



Evaluation steps:

1. Understand the Database Schema: Identify all tables used in both queries. List all columns referenced, along with their data types and constraints. Determine primary and foreign key relationships. Note any indexes or unique constraints that may affect query execution.
2. Parse and Break Down Each Query: Identify selected columns, functions, and expressions. Note the tables involved and the join conditions. Understand the filtering conditions applied. Identify grouping and aggregate conditions, if any. Determine if result ordering affects equivalence.
3. Compare Query Components: Check if both queries use the same tables and join conditions. Compare filtering conditions in the WHERE clauses. Assess whether the same columns and expressions are selected. Identify if different functions or syntaxes achieve the same result. Look for logical equivalence in expressions and calculations.
4. Consider Edge Cases and Data Variations: Conceptualize sample datasets that include edge cases (e.g., NULL values, zero values, special characters). Analyze how each query handles these edge cases. Ensure that data type differences do not affect the outcome. Verify that constraints (e.g., NOT NULL, UNIQUE) are accounted for.
5. Evaluate Aggregations and Calculations: Confirm that aggregate functions (e.g., SUM, COUNT) are applied identically. Ensure calculations (e.g., subtraction, addition) produce the same results.
6. Check for Logical Equivalence in Conditional Expressions: Compare conditional expressions like IIF, CASE WHEN, and IF. Determine if conditions and returned values are logically the same.
7. Assess Ordering of Results: If ORDER BY clause is present, confirm that both queries order results identically. Recognize that differing order may affect equivalence if result order is significant.
8. Generate a New Logical Equivalence Rule (If Applicable): Create an "Equivalent Queries: <query1>
<query2>
Schema Conditions:<conditions>" statement that defines the equivalence. Use GENERALIZED COLUMN and TABLE NAMES. Specify any necessary conditions based on the database schema. Present the rule clearly, indicating both the equivalence and the conditions under which it holds.



Example Equivalence Rules:

<Rule>
Equivalent Queries:
SELECT c1 from t1 WHERE ...;
SELECT c1 FROM t1 WHERE ...;
Schema Conditions:
None.
</Rule>



# Guidelines:
- Make SURE complete to every step PERFECTLY without ANY Mistakes
- Follow the Rules I Gave you and Remember to AVOID generating repeated equivalence rules in the examples I gave you.
- Be sure to format your response like the example equivalence rules I gave you.
- Put <New Rule></New Rule> around the new equivalence rule that you think of. Do not use other formatting around the equivalent queries.
- Use GENERALIZED COLUMN AND TABLE NAMES in any EQUIVALENCE RULE YOU WRITE. DO NOT USE THE SAME NAMES IN THE PROVIDED QUERY PAIRS!!!!
- If the two queries are not logically equivalent, say <New Rule> Not equivalent </New Rule>.
- If the new equivalence rule is already repeated in the examples listed, say <New Rule> Rule exists </New Rule>.
- The new rule should be be MINIMAL to CLEARLY demonstrate the highlighted semantic difference. Use ellipses to shorten SQL queries where necessary to achieve this.

Understand the Database Schema:\n- **Tables Involved**: `yearmonth`, `customers`\n- **Columns**:\n  - **`yearmonth`**: `CustomerID` (INTEGER, not null, foreign key), `Date` (TEXT, not null), `Consumption` (REAL)\n  - **`customers`**: `CustomerID` (INTEGER, primary key), `Segment` (TEXT), `Currency` (TEXT)\n- **Primary and Foreign Keys**:\n  - `customers.CustomerID` is a primary key.\n  - `yearmonth.CustomerID` is a foreign key referencing `customers.CustomerID`.\n- **Constraints**:\n  - `yearmonth.CustomerID` is not null.\n  - `customers.CustomerID` is unique and not null.\n\n### 2. Parse and Break Down Each Query:\n- **Gold SQL Query**:\n  - **SELECT**: `COUNT(*)`\n  - **FROM**: `yearmonth` (aliased as T1) INNER JOIN `customers` (aliased as T2)\n  - **ON**: `T1.CustomerID = T2.CustomerID`\n  - **WHERE**: `T2.Currency = 'EUR'` AND `T1.Consumption > 1000.00`\n\n- **Machine-generated SQL Query**:\n  - **SELECT**: `count(yearmonth.customerid)`\n  - **FROM**: `customers` INNER JOIN `yearmonth`\n  - **ON**: `customers.customerid = yearmonth.customerid`\n  - **WHERE**: `customers.currency = 'EUR'` AND `yearmonth.consumption > 1000`\n\n### 3. Compare Query Components:\n- Both queries use the same tables (`yearmonth` and `customers`) and join conditions (`CustomerID`).\n- Both have identical WHERE clauses filtering on `Currency` and `Consumption`.\n- The Gold Query uses `COUNT(*)` while the Machine-generated Query uses `count(yearmonth.customerid)`, but both effectively count the same set of rows due to the INNER JOIN and WHERE conditions.\n\n### 4. Consider Edge Cases and Data Variations:\n- Both queries should handle NULL values in the same way, but since `CustomerID` is not null in both tables, NULLs in this context are not a concern.\n- The `Currency` and `Consumption` conditions are directly comparable.\n\n### 5. Evaluate Aggregations and Calculations:\n- Both queries use a count function, and given the INNER JOIN and WHERE conditions, they will count the same rows.\n\n### 6. Check for Logical Equivalence in Conditional Expressions:\n- The WHERE conditions are logically identical.\n\n### 7. Assess Ordering of Results:\n- Neither query specifies an ORDER BY clause, so result ordering is not a concern for equivalence.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe two queries are logically equivalent for all possible database instances that satisfy the provided schema.\n\n### 8.

INFO:root:prompt: You are an expert SQL engineer with 20+ years of experience. You will be given some SQL equivalence rules conditional on some database schemas. You will then be given a pair of SQL queries, consisting of a gold query and a machine-generated query, and a database schema that defines the context of the queries. 

Your task is to compare the two provided SQL queries on logical equivalence and generate one more equivalence rule in the same format as the provided example equivalence rules.

Please make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please also keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.



Evaluation Criteria:

Logical equivalence - the alignment between the gold SQL query and the machine-generated SQL query. A machine-generated SQL query is logically equivalent to the gold query if these two queries would RETURN THE SAME RESULTS AND IN THE SAME ORDER for ALL POSSIBLE DATABASE INSTANCES that satisfy the provided database schema for these queries. Annotators were asked to penalize machine-generated queries that overlooked edge cases that the gold queries would have caught otherwise.



Evaluation steps:

1. Understand the Database Schema: Identify all tables used in both queries. List all columns referenced, along with their data types and constraints. Determine primary and foreign key relationships. Note any indexes or unique constraints that may affect query execution.
2. Parse and Break Down Each Query: Identify selected columns, functions, and expressions. Note the tables involved and the join conditions. Understand the filtering conditions applied. Identify grouping and aggregate conditions, if any. Determine if result ordering affects equivalence.
3. Compare Query Components: Check if both queries use the same tables and join conditions. Compare filtering conditions in the WHERE clauses. Assess whether the same columns and expressions are selected. Identify if different functions or syntaxes achieve the same result. Look for logical equivalence in expressions and calculations.
4. Consider Edge Cases and Data Variations: Conceptualize sample datasets that include edge cases (e.g., NULL values, zero values, special characters). Analyze how each query handles these edge cases. Ensure that data type differences do not affect the outcome. Verify that constraints (e.g., NOT NULL, UNIQUE) are accounted for.
5. Evaluate Aggregations and Calculations: Confirm that aggregate functions (e.g., SUM, COUNT) are applied identically. Ensure calculations (e.g., subtraction, addition) produce the same results.
6. Check for Logical Equivalence in Conditional Expressions: Compare conditional expressions like IIF, CASE WHEN, and IF. Determine if conditions and returned values are logically the same.
7. Assess Ordering of Results: If ORDER BY clause is present, confirm that both queries order results identically. Recognize that differing order may affect equivalence if result order is significant.
8. Generate a New Logical Equivalence Rule (If Applicable): Create an "Equivalent Queries: <query1>
<query2>
Schema Conditions:<conditions>" statement that defines the equivalence. Use GENERALIZED COLUMN and TABLE NAMES. Specify any necessary conditions based on the database schema. Present the rule clearly, indicating both the equivalence and the conditions under which it holds.



Example Equivalence Rules:

<Rule>
Equivalent Queries:
SELECT c1 from t1 WHERE ...;
SELECT c1 FROM t1 WHERE ...;
Schema Conditions:
None.
</Rule>



# Guidelines:
- Make SURE complete to every step PERFECTLY without ANY Mistakes
- Follow the Rules I Gave you and Remember to AVOID generating repeated equivalence rules in the examples I gave you.
- Be sure to format your response like the example equivalence rules I gave you.
- Put <New Rule></New Rule> around the new equivalence rule that you think of. Do not use other formatting around the equivalent queries.
- Use GENERALIZED COLUMN AND TABLE NAMES in any EQUIVALENCE RULE YOU WRITE. DO NOT USE THE SAME NAMES IN THE PROVIDED QUERY PAIRS!!!!
- If the two queries are not logically equivalent, say <New Rule> Not equivalent </New Rule>.
- If the new equivalence rule is already repeated in the examples listed, say <New Rule> Rule exists </New Rule>.
- The new rule should be be MINIMAL to CLEARLY demonstrate the highlighted semantic difference. Use ellipses to shorten SQL queries where necessary to achieve this.

INFO:root:prompt: You are an expert SQL engineer with 20+ years of experience. You will be given some SQL equivalence rules conditional on some database schemas. You will then be given a pair of SQL queries, consisting of a gold query and a machine-generated query, and a database schema that defines the context of the queries. 

Your task is to compare the two provided SQL queries on logical equivalence and generate one more equivalence rule in the same format as the provided example equivalence rules.

Please make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please also keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.



Evaluation Criteria:

Logical equivalence - the alignment between the gold SQL query and the machine-generated SQL query. A machine-generated SQL query is logically equivalent to the gold query if these two queries would RETURN THE SAME RESULTS AND IN THE SAME ORDER for ALL POSSIBLE DATABASE INSTANCES that satisfy the provided database schema for these queries. Annotators were asked to penalize machine-generated queries that overlooked edge cases that the gold queries would have caught otherwise.



Evaluation steps:

1. Understand the Database Schema: Identify all tables used in both queries. List all columns referenced, along with their data types and constraints. Determine primary and foreign key relationships. Note any indexes or unique constraints that may affect query execution.
2. Parse and Break Down Each Query: Identify selected columns, functions, and expressions. Note the tables involved and the join conditions. Understand the filtering conditions applied. Identify grouping and aggregate conditions, if any. Determine if result ordering affects equivalence.
3. Compare Query Components: Check if both queries use the same tables and join conditions. Compare filtering conditions in the WHERE clauses. Assess whether the same columns and expressions are selected. Identify if different functions or syntaxes achieve the same result. Look for logical equivalence in expressions and calculations.
4. Consider Edge Cases and Data Variations: Conceptualize sample datasets that include edge cases (e.g., NULL values, zero values, special characters). Analyze how each query handles these edge cases. Ensure that data type differences do not affect the outcome. Verify that constraints (e.g., NOT NULL, UNIQUE) are accounted for.
5. Evaluate Aggregations and Calculations: Confirm that aggregate functions (e.g., SUM, COUNT) are applied identically. Ensure calculations (e.g., subtraction, addition) produce the same results.
6. Check for Logical Equivalence in Conditional Expressions: Compare conditional expressions like IIF, CASE WHEN, and IF. Determine if conditions and returned values are logically the same.
7. Assess Ordering of Results: If ORDER BY clause is present, confirm that both queries order results identically. Recognize that differing order may affect equivalence if result order is significant.
8. Generate a New Logical Equivalence Rule (If Applicable): Create an "Equivalent Queries: <query1>
<query2>
Schema Conditions:<conditions>" statement that defines the equivalence. Use GENERALIZED COLUMN and TABLE NAMES. Specify any necessary conditions based on the database schema. Present the rule clearly, indicating both the equivalence and the conditions under which it holds.



Example Equivalence Rules:

<Rule>
Equivalent Queries:
SELECT c1 from t1 WHERE ...;
SELECT c1 FROM t1 WHERE ...;
Schema Conditions:
None.
</Rule>



# Guidelines:
- Make SURE complete to every step PERFECTLY without ANY Mistakes
- Follow the Rules I Gave you and Remember to AVOID generating repeated equivalence rules in the examples I gave you.
- Be sure to format your response like the example equivalence rules I gave you.
- Put <New Rule></New Rule> around the new equivalence rule that you think of. Do not use other formatting around the equivalent queries.
- Use GENERALIZED COLUMN AND TABLE NAMES in any EQUIVALENCE RULE YOU WRITE. DO NOT USE THE SAME NAMES IN THE PROVIDED QUERY PAIRS!!!!
- If the two queries are not logically equivalent, say <New Rule> Not equivalent </New Rule>.
- If the new equivalence rule is already repeated in the examples listed, say <New Rule> Rule exists </New Rule>.
- The new rule should be be MINIMAL to CLEARLY demonstrate the highlighted semantic difference. Use ellipses to shorten SQL queries where necessary to achieve this.

Take a Deep Breath and Carefully Follow the Rules, Guides and Examples I gave you. I will tip you $2000 if you do EVERYTHING Perfectly.

INFO:root:prompt: You are an expert SQL engineer with 20+ years of experience. You will be given some SQL equivalence rules conditional on some database schemas. You will then be given a pair of SQL queries, consisting of a gold query and a machine-generated query, and a database schema that defines the context of the queries. 

Your task is to compare the two provided SQL queries on logical equivalence and generate one more equivalence rule in the same format as the provided example equivalence rules.

Please make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please also keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.



Evaluation Criteria:

Logical equivalence - the alignment between the gold SQL query and the machine-generated SQL query. A machine-generated SQL query is logically equivalent to the gold query if these two queries would RETURN THE SAME RESULTS AND IN THE SAME ORDER for ALL POSSIBLE DATABASE INSTANCES that satisfy the provided database schema for these queries. Annotators were asked to penalize machine-generated queries that overlooked edge cases that the gold queries would have caught otherwise.



Evaluation steps:

1. Understand the Database Schema: Identify all tables used in both queries. List all columns referenced, along with their data types and constraints. Determine primary and foreign key relationships. Note any indexes or unique constraints that may affect query execution.
2. Parse and Break Down Each Query: Identify selected columns, functions, and expressions. Note the tables involved and the join conditions. Understand the filtering conditions applied. Identify grouping and aggregate conditions, if any. Determine if result ordering affects equivalence.
3. Compare Query Components: Check if both queries use the same tables and join conditions. Compare filtering conditions in the WHERE clauses. Assess whether the same columns and expressions are selected. Identify if different functions or syntaxes achieve the same result. Look for logical equivalence in expressions and calculations.
4. Consider Edge Cases and Data Variations: Conceptualize sample datasets that include edge cases (e.g., NULL values, zero values, special characters). Analyze how each query handles these edge cases. Ensure that data type differences do not affect the outcome. Verify that constraints (e.g., NOT NULL, UNIQUE) are accounted for.
5. Evaluate Aggregations and Calculations: Confirm that aggregate functions (e.g., SUM, COUNT) are applied identically. Ensure calculations (e.g., subtraction, addition) produce the same results.
6. Check for Logical Equivalence in Conditional Expressions: Compare conditional expressions like IIF, CASE WHEN, and IF. Determine if conditions and returned values are logically the same.
7. Assess Ordering of Results: If ORDER BY clause is present, confirm that both queries order results identically. Recognize that differing order may affect equivalence if result order is significant.
8. Generate a New Logical Equivalence Rule (If Applicable): Create an "Equivalent Queries: <query1>
<query2>
Schema Conditions:<conditions>" statement that defines the equivalence. Use GENERALIZED COLUMN and TABLE NAMES. Specify any necessary conditions based on the database schema. Present the rule clearly, indicating both the equivalence and the conditions under which it holds.



Example Equivalence Rules:

<Rule>
Equivalent Queries:
SELECT c1 from t1 WHERE ...;
SELECT c1 FROM t1 WHERE ...;
Schema Conditions:
None.
</Rule>



# Guidelines:
- Make SURE complete to every step PERFECTLY without ANY Mistakes
- Follow the Rules I Gave you and Remember to AVOID generating repeated equivalence rules in the examples I gave you.
- Be sure to format your response like the example equivalence rules I gave you.
- Put <New Rule></New Rule> around the new equivalence rule that you think of. Do not use other formatting around the equivalent queries.
- Use GENERALIZED COLUMN AND TABLE NAMES in any EQUIVALENCE RULE YOU WRITE. DO NOT USE THE SAME NAMES IN THE PROVIDED QUERY PAIRS!!!!
- If the two queries are not logically equivalent, say <New Rule> Not equivalent </New Rule>.
- If the new equivalence rule is already repeated in the examples listed, say <New Rule> Rule exists </New Rule>.
- The new rule should be be MINIMAL to CLEARLY demonstrate the highlighted semantic difference. Use ellipses to shorten SQL queries where necessary to achieve this.

Take a Deep Breath and Carefully Follow the Rules, Guides and Examples I gave you. I will tip you $2000 if you do EVERYTHING Perfectly.

INFO:root:prompt: You are an expert SQL engineer with 20+ years of experience. You will be given some SQL equivalence rules conditional on some database schemas. You will then be given a pair of SQL queries, consisting of a gold query and a machine-generated query, and a database schema that defines the context of the queries. 

Your task is to compare the two provided SQL queries on logical equivalence and generate one more equivalence rule in the same format as the provided example equivalence rules.

Please make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please also keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.



Evaluation Criteria:

Logical equivalence - the alignment between the gold SQL query and the machine-generated SQL query. A machine-generated SQL query is logically equivalent to the gold query if these two queries would RETURN THE SAME RESULTS AND IN THE SAME ORDER for ALL POSSIBLE DATABASE INSTANCES that satisfy the provided database schema for these queries. Annotators were asked to penalize machine-generated queries that overlooked edge cases that the gold queries would have caught otherwise.



Evaluation steps:

1. Understand the Database Schema: Identify all tables used in both queries. List all columns referenced, along with their data types and constraints. Determine primary and foreign key relationships. Note any indexes or unique constraints that may affect query execution.
2. Parse and Break Down Each Query: Identify selected columns, functions, and expressions. Note the tables involved and the join conditions. Understand the filtering conditions applied. Identify grouping and aggregate conditions, if any. Determine if result ordering affects equivalence.
3. Compare Query Components: Check if both queries use the same tables and join conditions. Compare filtering conditions in the WHERE clauses. Assess whether the same columns and expressions are selected. Identify if different functions or syntaxes achieve the same result. Look for logical equivalence in expressions and calculations.
4. Consider Edge Cases and Data Variations: Conceptualize sample datasets that include edge cases (e.g., NULL values, zero values, special characters). Analyze how each query handles these edge cases. Ensure that data type differences do not affect the outcome. Verify that constraints (e.g., NOT NULL, UNIQUE) are accounted for.
5. Evaluate Aggregations and Calculations: Confirm that aggregate functions (e.g., SUM, COUNT) are applied identically. Ensure calculations (e.g., subtraction, addition) produce the same results.
6. Check for Logical Equivalence in Conditional Expressions: Compare conditional expressions like IIF, CASE WHEN, and IF. Determine if conditions and returned values are logically the same.
7. Assess Ordering of Results: If ORDER BY clause is present, confirm that both queries order results identically. Recognize that differing order may affect equivalence if result order is significant.
8. Generate a New Logical Equivalence Rule (If Applicable): Create an "Equivalent Queries: <query1>
<query2>
Schema Conditions:<conditions>" statement that defines the equivalence. Use GENERALIZED COLUMN and TABLE NAMES. Specify any necessary conditions based on the database schema. Present the rule clearly, indicating both the equivalence and the conditions under which it holds.



Example Equivalence Rules:

<Rule>
Equivalent Queries:
SELECT c1 from t1 WHERE ...;
SELECT c1 FROM t1 WHERE ...;
Schema Conditions:
None.
</Rule>



# Guidelines:
- Make SURE complete to every step PERFECTLY without ANY Mistakes
- Follow the Rules I Gave you and Remember to AVOID generating repeated equivalence rules in the examples I gave you.
- Be sure to format your response like the example equivalence rules I gave you.
- Put <New Rule></New Rule> around the new equivalence rule that you think of. Do not use other formatting around the equivalent queries.
- Use GENERALIZED COLUMN AND TABLE NAMES in any EQUIVALENCE RULE YOU WRITE. DO NOT USE THE SAME NAMES IN THE PROVIDED QUERY PAIRS!!!!
- If the two queries are not logically equivalent, say <New Rule> Not equivalent </New Rule>.
- If the new equivalence rule is already repeated in the examples listed, say <New Rule> Rule exists </New Rule>.
- The new rule should be be MINIMAL to CLEARLY demonstrate the highlighted semantic difference. Use ellipses to shorten SQL queries where necessary to achieve this.

Take a Deep Breath and Carefully Follow the Rules, Guides and Examples I gave you. I will tip you $2000 if you do EVERYTHING Perfectly.

INFO:root:prompt: You are an expert SQL engineer with 20+ years of experience. You will be given some SQL equivalence rules conditional on some database schemas. You will then be given a pair of SQL queries, consisting of a gold query and a machine-generated query, and a database schema that defines the context of the queries. 

Your task is to compare the two provided SQL queries on logical equivalence and generate one more equivalence rule in the same format as the provided example equivalence rules.

Please make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please also keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.



Evaluation Criteria:

Logical equivalence - the alignment between the gold SQL query and the machine-generated SQL query. A machine-generated SQL query is logically equivalent to the gold query if these two queries would RETURN THE SAME RESULTS AND IN THE SAME ORDER for ALL POSSIBLE DATABASE INSTANCES that satisfy the provided database schema for these queries. Annotators were asked to penalize machine-generated queries that overlooked edge cases that the gold queries would have caught otherwise.



Evaluation steps:

1. Understand the Database Schema: Identify all tables used in both queries. List all columns referenced, along with their data types and constraints. Determine primary and foreign key relationships. Note any indexes or unique constraints that may affect query execution.
2. Parse and Break Down Each Query: Identify selected columns, functions, and expressions. Note the tables involved and the join conditions. Understand the filtering conditions applied. Identify grouping and aggregate conditions, if any. Determine if result ordering affects equivalence.
3. Compare Query Components: Check if both queries use the same tables and join conditions. Compare filtering conditions in the WHERE clauses. Assess whether the same columns and expressions are selected. Identify if different functions or syntaxes achieve the same result. Look for logical equivalence in expressions and calculations.
4. Consider Edge Cases and Data Variations: Conceptualize sample datasets that include edge cases (e.g., NULL values, zero values, special characters). Analyze how each query handles these edge cases. Ensure that data type differences do not affect the outcome. Verify that constraints (e.g., NOT NULL, UNIQUE) are accounted for.
5. Evaluate Aggregations and Calculations: Confirm that aggregate functions (e.g., SUM, COUNT) are applied identically. Ensure calculations (e.g., subtraction, addition) produce the same results.
6. Check for Logical Equivalence in Conditional Expressions: Compare conditional expressions like IIF, CASE WHEN, and IF. Determine if conditions and returned values are logically the same.
7. Assess Ordering of Results: If ORDER BY clause is present, confirm that both queries order results identically. Recognize that differing order may affect equivalence if result order is significant.
8. Generate a New Logical Equivalence Rule (If Applicable): Create an "Equivalent Queries: <query1>
<query2>
Schema Conditions:<conditions>" statement that defines the equivalence. Use GENERALIZED COLUMN and TABLE NAMES. Specify any necessary conditions based on the database schema. Present the rule clearly, indicating both the equivalence and the conditions under which it holds.



Example Equivalence Rules:

<Rule>
Equivalent Queries:
SELECT c1 from t1 WHERE ...;
SELECT c1 FROM t1 WHERE ...;
Schema Conditions:
None.
</Rule>



# Guidelines:
- Make SURE complete to every step PERFECTLY without ANY Mistakes
- Follow the Rules I Gave you and Remember to AVOID generating repeated equivalence rules in the examples I gave you.
- Be sure to format your response like the example equivalence rules I gave you.
- Put <New Rule></New Rule> around the new equivalence rule that you think of. Do not use other formatting around the equivalent queries.
- Use GENERALIZED COLUMN AND TABLE NAMES in any EQUIVALENCE RULE YOU WRITE. DO NOT USE THE SAME NAMES IN THE PROVIDED QUERY PAIRS!!!!
- If the two queries are not logically equivalent, say <New Rule> Not equivalent </New Rule>.
- If the new equivalence rule is already repeated in the examples listed, say <New Rule> Rule exists </New Rule>.
- The new rule should be be MINIMAL to CLEARLY demonstrate the highlighted semantic difference. Use ellipses to shorten SQL queries where necessary to achieve this.

INFO:root:prompt: You are an expert SQL engineer with 20+ years of experience. You will be given some SQL equivalence rules conditional on some database schemas. You will then be given a pair of SQL queries, consisting of a gold query and a machine-generated query, and a database schema that defines the context of the queries. 

Your task is to compare the two provided SQL queries on logical equivalence and generate one more equivalence rule in the same format as the provided example equivalence rules.

Please make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please also keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.



Evaluation Criteria:

Logical equivalence - the alignment between the gold SQL query and the machine-generated SQL query. A machine-generated SQL query is logically equivalent to the gold query if these two queries would RETURN THE SAME RESULTS AND IN THE SAME ORDER for ALL POSSIBLE DATABASE INSTANCES that satisfy the provided database schema for these queries. Annotators were asked to penalize machine-generated queries that overlooked edge cases that the gold queries would have caught otherwise.



Evaluation steps:

1. Understand the Database Schema: Identify all tables used in both queries. List all columns referenced, along with their data types and constraints. Determine primary and foreign key relationships. Note any indexes or unique constraints that may affect query execution.
2. Parse and Break Down Each Query: Identify selected columns, functions, and expressions. Note the tables involved and the join conditions. Understand the filtering conditions applied. Identify grouping and aggregate conditions, if any. Determine if result ordering affects equivalence.
3. Compare Query Components: Check if both queries use the same tables and join conditions. Compare filtering conditions in the WHERE clauses. Assess whether the same columns and expressions are selected. Identify if different functions or syntaxes achieve the same result. Look for logical equivalence in expressions and calculations.
4. Consider Edge Cases and Data Variations: Conceptualize sample datasets that include edge cases (e.g., NULL values, zero values, special characters). Analyze how each query handles these edge cases. Ensure that data type differences do not affect the outcome. Verify that constraints (e.g., NOT NULL, UNIQUE) are accounted for.
5. Evaluate Aggregations and Calculations: Confirm that aggregate functions (e.g., SUM, COUNT) are applied identically. Ensure calculations (e.g., subtraction, addition) produce the same results.
6. Check for Logical Equivalence in Conditional Expressions: Compare conditional expressions like IIF, CASE WHEN, and IF. Determine if conditions and returned values are logically the same.
7. Assess Ordering of Results: If ORDER BY clause is present, confirm that both queries order results identically. Recognize that differing order may affect equivalence if result order is significant.
8. Generate a New Logical Equivalence Rule (If Applicable): Create an "Equivalent Queries: <query1>
<query2>
Schema Conditions:<conditions>" statement that defines the equivalence. Use GENERALIZED COLUMN and TABLE NAMES. Specify any necessary conditions based on the database schema. Present the rule clearly, indicating both the equivalence and the conditions under which it holds.



Example Equivalence Rules:

<Rule>
Equivalent Queries:
SELECT c1 from t1 WHERE ...;
SELECT c1 FROM t1 WHERE ...;
Schema Conditions:
None.
</Rule>



# Guidelines:
- Make SURE complete to every step PERFECTLY without ANY Mistakes
- Follow the Rules I Gave you and Remember to AVOID generating repeated equivalence rules in the examples I gave you.
- Be sure to format your response like the example equivalence rules I gave you.
- Put <New Rule></New Rule> around the new equivalence rule that you think of. Do not use other formatting around the equivalent queries.
- Use GENERALIZED COLUMN AND TABLE NAMES in any EQUIVALENCE RULE YOU WRITE. DO NOT USE THE SAME NAMES IN THE PROVIDED QUERY PAIRS!!!!
- If the two queries are not logically equivalent, say <New Rule> Not equivalent </New Rule>.
- If the new equivalence rule is already repeated in the examples listed, say <New Rule> Rule exists </New Rule>.
- The new rule should be be MINIMAL to CLEARLY demonstrate the highlighted semantic difference. Use ellipses to shorten SQL queries where necessary to achieve this.

Take a Deep Breath and Carefully Follow the Rules, Guides and Examples I gave you. I will tip you $2000 if you do EVERYTHING Perfectly.

Evaluation Criteria:

Logical equivalence - the alignment between the gold SQL query and the machine-generated SQL query. A machine-generated SQL query is logically equivalent to the gold query if these two queries would RETURN THE SAME RESULTS AND IN THE SAME ORDER for ALL POSSIBLE DATABASE INSTANCES that satisfy the provided database schema for these queries. Annotators were asked to penalize machine-generated queries that overlooked edge cases that the gold queries would have caught otherwise.



Evaluation steps:

1. Understand the Database Schema: Identify all tables used in both queries. List all columns referenced, along with their data types and constraints. Determine primary and foreign key relationships. Note any indexes or unique constraints that may affect query execution.
2. Parse and Break Down Each Query: Identify selected columns, functions, and expressions. Note the tables involved and the join conditions. Understand the filtering conditions applied. Identify grouping and aggregate conditions, if any. Determine if result ordering affects equivalence.
3. Compare Query Components: Check if both queries use the same tables and join conditions. Compare filtering conditions in the WHERE clauses. Assess whether the same columns and expressions are selected. Identify if different functions or syntaxes achieve the same result. Look for logical equivalence in expressions and calculations.
4. Consider Edge Cases and Data Variations: Conceptualize sample datasets that include edge cases (e.g., NULL values, zero values, special characters). Analyze how each query handles these edge cases. Ensure that data type differences do not affect the outcome. Verify that constraints (e.g., NOT NULL, UNIQUE) are accounted for.
5. Evaluate Aggregations and Calculations: Confirm that aggregate functions (e.g., SUM, COUNT) are applied identically. Ensure calculations (e.g., subtraction, addition) produce the same results.
6. Check for Logical Equivalence in Conditional Expressions: Compare conditional expressions like IIF, CASE WHEN, and IF. Determine if conditions and returned values are logically the same.
7. Assess Ordering of Results: If ORDER BY clause is present, confirm that both queries order results identically. Recognize that differing order may affect equivalence if result order is significant.
8. Generate a New Logical Equivalence Rule (If Applicable): Create an "Equivalent Queries: <query1>
<query2>
Schema Conditions:<conditions>" statement that defines the equivalence. Use GENERALIZED COLUMN and TABLE NAMES. Specify any necessary conditions based on the database schema. Present the rule clearly, indicating both the equivalence and the conditions under which it holds.



Example Equivalence Rules:

<Rule>
Equivalent Queries:
SELECT c1 from t1 WHERE ...;
SELECT c1 FROM t1 WHERE ...;
Schema Conditions:
None.
</Rule>



# Guidelines:
- Make SURE complete to every step PERFECTLY without ANY Mistakes
- Follow the Rules I Gave you and Remember to AVOID generating repeated equivalence rules in the examples I gave you.
- Be sure to format your response like the example equivalence rules I gave you.
- Put <New Rule></New Rule> around the new equivalence rule that you think of. Do not use other formatting around the equivalent queries.
- Use GENERALIZED COLUMN AND TABLE NAMES in any EQUIVALENCE RULE YOU WRITE. DO NOT USE THE SAME NAMES IN THE PROVIDED QUERY PAIRS!!!!
- If the two queries are not logically equivalent, say <New Rule> Not equivalent </New Rule>.
- If the new equivalence rule is already repeated in the examples listed, say <New Rule> Rule exists </New Rule>.
- The new rule should be be MINIMAL to CLEARLY demonstrate the highlighted semantic difference. Use ellipses to shorten SQL queries where necessary to achieve this.

Take a Deep Breath and Carefully Follow the Rules, Guides and Examples I gave you. I will tip you $2000 if you do EVERYTHING Perfectly.

Your task is to compare the two provided SQL queries on logical equivalence and generate one more equivalence rule in the same format as the provided example equivalence rules.

INFO:root:prompt: You are an expert SQL engineer with 20+ years of experience. You will be given some SQL equivalence rules conditional on some database schemas. You will then be given a pair of SQL queries, consisting of a gold query and a machine-generated query, and a database schema that defines the context of the queries. 

Your task is to compare the two provided SQL queries on logical equivalence and generate one more equivalence rule in the same format as the provided example equivalence rules.

Please make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please also keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.



Evaluation Criteria:

Logical equivalence - the alignment between the gold SQL query and the machine-generated SQL query. A machine-generated SQL query is logically equivalent to the gold query if these two queries would RETURN THE SAME RESULTS AND IN THE SAME ORDER for ALL POSSIBLE DATABASE INSTANCES that satisfy the provided database schema for these queries. Annotators were asked to penalize machine-generated queries that overlooked edge cases that the gold queries would have caught otherwise.



Evaluation steps:

1. Understand the Database Schema: Identify all tables used in both queries. List all columns referenced, along with their data types and constraints. Determine primary and foreign key relationships. Note any indexes or unique constraints that may affect query execution.
2. Parse and Break Down Each Query: Identify selected columns, functions, and expressions. Note the tables involved and the join conditions. Understand the filtering conditions applied. Identify grouping and aggregate conditions, if any. Determine if result ordering affects equivalence.
3. Compare Query Components: Check if both queries use the same tables and join conditions. Compare filtering conditions in the WHERE clauses. Assess whether the same columns and expressions are selected. Identify if different functions or syntaxes achieve the same result. Look for logical equivalence in expressions and calculations.
4. Consider Edge Cases and Data Variations: Conceptualize sample datasets that include edge cases (e.g., NULL values, zero values, special characters). Analyze how each query handles these edge cases. Ensure that data type differences do not affect the outcome. Verify that constraints (e.g., NOT NULL, UNIQUE) are accounted for.
5. Evaluate Aggregations and Calculations: Confirm that aggregate functions (e.g., SUM, COUNT) are applied identically. Ensure calculations (e.g., subtraction, addition) produce the same results.
6. Check for Logical Equivalence in Conditional Expressions: Compare conditional expressions like IIF, CASE WHEN, and IF. Determine if conditions and returned values are logically the same.
7. Assess Ordering of Results: If ORDER BY clause is present, confirm that both queries order results identically. Recognize that differing order may affect equivalence if result order is significant.
8. Generate a New Logical Equivalence Rule (If Applicable): Create an "Equivalent Queries: <query1>
<query2>
Schema Conditions:<conditions>" statement that defines the equivalence. Use GENERALIZED COLUMN and TABLE NAMES. Specify any necessary conditions based on the database schema. Present the rule clearly, indicating both the equivalence and the conditions under which it holds.



Example Equivalence Rules:

<Rule>
Equivalent Queries:
SELECT c1 from t1 WHERE ...;
SELECT c1 FROM t1 WHERE ...;
Schema Conditions:
None.
</Rule>



# Guidelines:
- Make SURE complete to every step PERFECTLY without ANY Mistakes
- Follow the Rules I Gave you and Remember to AVOID generating repeated equivalence rules in the examples I gave you.
- Be sure to format your response like the example equivalence rules I gave you.
- Put <New Rule></New Rule> around the new equivalence rule that you think of. Do not use other formatting around the equivalent queries.
- Use GENERALIZED COLUMN AND TABLE NAMES in any EQUIVALENCE RULE YOU WRITE. DO NOT USE THE SAME NAMES IN THE PROVIDED QUERY PAIRS!!!!
- If the two queries are not logically equivalent, say <New Rule> Not equivalent </New Rule>.
- If the new equivalence rule is already repeated in the examples listed, say <New Rule> Rule exists </New Rule>.
- The new rule should be be MINIMAL to CLEARLY demonstrate the highlighted semantic difference. Use ellipses to shorten SQL queries where necessary to achieve this.

Take a Deep Breath and Carefully Follow the Rules, Guides and Examples I gave you. I will tip you $2000 if you do EVERYTHING Perfectly.

INFO:root:prompt: You are an expert SQL engineer with 20+ years of experience. You will be given some SQL equivalence rules conditional on some database schemas. You will then be given a pair of SQL queries, consisting of a gold query and a machine-generated query, and a database schema that defines the context of the queries. 

Your task is to compare the two provided SQL queries on logical equivalence and generate one more equivalence rule in the same format as the provided example equivalence rules.

Please make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please also keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.



Evaluation Criteria:

Logical equivalence - the alignment between the gold SQL query and the machine-generated SQL query. A machine-generated SQL query is logically equivalent to the gold query if these two queries would RETURN THE SAME RESULTS AND IN THE SAME ORDER for ALL POSSIBLE DATABASE INSTANCES that satisfy the provided database schema for these queries. Annotators were asked to penalize machine-generated queries that overlooked edge cases that the gold queries would have caught otherwise.



Evaluation steps:

1. Understand the Database Schema: Identify all tables used in both queries. List all columns referenced, along with their data types and constraints. Determine primary and foreign key relationships. Note any indexes or unique constraints that may affect query execution.
2. Parse and Break Down Each Query: Identify selected columns, functions, and expressions. Note the tables involved and the join conditions. Understand the filtering conditions applied. Identify grouping and aggregate conditions, if any. Determine if result ordering affects equivalence.
3. Compare Query Components: Check if both queries use the same tables and join conditions. Compare filtering conditions in the WHERE clauses. Assess whether the same columns and expressions are selected. Identify if different functions or syntaxes achieve the same result. Look for logical equivalence in expressions and calculations.
4. Consider Edge Cases and Data Variations: Conceptualize sample datasets that include edge cases (e.g., NULL values, zero values, special characters). Analyze how each query handles these edge cases. Ensure that data type differences do not affect the outcome. Verify that constraints (e.g., NOT NULL, UNIQUE) are accounted for.
5. Evaluate Aggregations and Calculations: Confirm that aggregate functions (e.g., SUM, COUNT) are applied identically. Ensure calculations (e.g., subtraction, addition) produce the same results.
6. Check for Logical Equivalence in Conditional Expressions: Compare conditional expressions like IIF, CASE WHEN, and IF. Determine if conditions and returned values are logically the same.
7. Assess Ordering of Results: If ORDER BY clause is present, confirm that both queries order results identically. Recognize that differing order may affect equivalence if result order is significant.
8. Generate a New Logical Equivalence Rule (If Applicable): Create an "Equivalent Queries: <query1>
<query2>
Schema Conditions:<conditions>" statement that defines the equivalence. Use GENERALIZED COLUMN and TABLE NAMES. Specify any necessary conditions based on the database schema. Present the rule clearly, indicating both the equivalence and the conditions under which it holds.



Example Equivalence Rules:

<Rule>
Equivalent Queries:
SELECT c1 from t1 WHERE ...;
SELECT c1 FROM t1 WHERE ...;
Schema Conditions:
None.
</Rule>



# Guidelines:
- Make SURE complete to every step PERFECTLY without ANY Mistakes
- Follow the Rules I Gave you and Remember to AVOID generating repeated equivalence rules in the examples I gave you.
- Be sure to format your response like the example equivalence rules I gave you.
- Put <New Rule></New Rule> around the new equivalence rule that you think of. Do not use other formatting around the equivalent queries.
- Use GENERALIZED COLUMN AND TABLE NAMES in any EQUIVALENCE RULE YOU WRITE. DO NOT USE THE SAME NAMES IN THE PROVIDED QUERY PAIRS!!!!
- If the two queries are not logically equivalent, say <New Rule> Not equivalent </New Rule>.

Therefore, both queries are logically equivalent.\n\n### Step 8: Generate a New Logical Equivalence Rule\nThe equivalence observed here can be generalized into a new rule.\n\n<New Rule>\nEquivalent Queries:\nSELECT SUM(c1) FROM t1 WHERE c2 = 'constant';\nSELECT SUM(t1.c1) FROM t1 INNER JOIN t2 ON t1.c3 = t2.c4 WHERE t1.c2 = 'constant';\nSchema Conditions:\nt1.c3 is a foreign key referencing t2.c4.\n", role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None, refusal=None))], created=1732077144, model='gpt-4o-2024-08-06', object='chat.completion', system_fingerprint='fp_831e067d82', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=580, prompt_tokens=1473, total_tokens=2053, prompt_tokens_details={'cached_tokens': 0, 'audio_tokens': 0}, completion_tokens_details={'reasoning_tokens': 0, 'audio_tokens': 0, 'accepted_prediction_tokens': 0, 'rejected_prediction_tokens': 0}))

INFO:root:prompt: You are an expert SQL engineer with 20+ years of experience. You will be given some SQL equivalence rules conditional on some database schemas. You will then be given a pair of SQL queries, consisting of a gold query and a machine-generated query, and a database schema that defines the context of the queries. 

Your task is to compare the two provided SQL queries on logical equivalence and generate one more equivalence rule in the same format as the provided example equivalence rules.

Please make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please also keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.



Evaluation Criteria:

Logical equivalence - the alignment between the gold SQL query and the machine-generated SQL query. A machine-generated SQL query is logically equivalent to the gold query if these two queries would RETURN THE SAME RESULTS AND IN THE SAME ORDER for ALL POSSIBLE DATABASE INSTANCES that satisfy the provided database schema for these queries. Annotators were asked to penalize machine-generated queries that overlooked edge cases that the gold queries would have caught otherwise.



Evaluation steps:

1. Understand the Database Schema: Identify all tables used in both queries. List all columns referenced, along with their data types and constraints. Determine primary and foreign key relationships. Note any indexes or unique constraints that may affect query execution.
2. Parse and Break Down Each Query: Identify selected columns, functions, and expressions. Note the tables involved and the join conditions. Understand the filtering conditions applied. Identify grouping and aggregate conditions, if any. Determine if result ordering affects equivalence.
3. Compare Query Components: Check if both queries use the same tables and join conditions. Compare filtering conditions in the WHERE clauses. Assess whether the same columns and expressions are selected. Identify if different functions or syntaxes achieve the same result. Look for logical equivalence in expressions and calculations.
4. Consider Edge Cases and Data Variations: Conceptualize sample datasets that include edge cases (e.g., NULL values, zero values, special characters). Analyze how each query handles these edge cases. Ensure that data type differences do not affect the outcome. Verify that constraints (e.g., NOT NULL, UNIQUE) are accounted for.
5. Evaluate Aggregations and Calculations: Confirm that aggregate functions (e.g., SUM, COUNT) are applied identically. Ensure calculations (e.g., subtraction, addition) produce the same results.
6. Check for Logical Equivalence in Conditional Expressions: Compare conditional expressions like IIF, CASE WHEN, and IF. Determine if conditions and returned values are logically the same.
7. Assess Ordering of Results: If ORDER BY clause is present, confirm that both queries order results identically. Recognize that differing order may affect equivalence if result order is significant.
8. Generate a New Logical Equivalence Rule (If Applicable): Create an "Equivalent Queries: <query1>
<query2>
Schema Conditions:<conditions>" statement that defines the equivalence. Use GENERALIZED COLUMN and TABLE NAMES. Specify any necessary conditions based on the database schema. Present the rule clearly, indicating both the equivalence and the conditions under which it holds.



Example Equivalence Rules:

<Rule>
Equivalent Queries:
SELECT c1 from t1 WHERE ...;
SELECT c1 FROM t1 WHERE ...;
Schema Conditions:
None.

INFO:root:prompt: You are an expert SQL engineer with 20+ years of experience. You will be given some SQL equivalence rules conditional on some database schemas. You will then be given a pair of SQL queries, consisting of a gold query and a machine-generated query, and a database schema that defines the context of the queries. 

Your task is to compare the two provided SQL queries on logical equivalence and generate one more equivalence rule in the same format as the provided example equivalence rules.

Please make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please also keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.



Evaluation Criteria:

Logical equivalence - the alignment between the gold SQL query and the machine-generated SQL query. A machine-generated SQL query is logically equivalent to the gold query if these two queries would RETURN THE SAME RESULTS AND IN THE SAME ORDER for ALL POSSIBLE DATABASE INSTANCES that satisfy the provided database schema for these queries. Annotators were asked to penalize machine-generated queries that overlooked edge cases that the gold queries would have caught otherwise.



Evaluation steps:

1. Understand the Database Schema: Identify all tables used in both queries. List all columns referenced, along with their data types and constraints. Determine primary and foreign key relationships. Note any indexes or unique constraints that may affect query execution.
2. Parse and Break Down Each Query: Identify selected columns, functions, and expressions. Note the tables involved and the join conditions. Understand the filtering conditions applied. Identify grouping and aggregate conditions, if any. Determine if result ordering affects equivalence.
3. Compare Query Components: Check if both queries use the same tables and join conditions. Compare filtering conditions in the WHERE clauses. Assess whether the same columns and expressions are selected. Identify if different functions or syntaxes achieve the same result. Look for logical equivalence in expressions and calculations.
4. Consider Edge Cases and Data Variations: Conceptualize sample datasets that include edge cases (e.g., NULL values, zero values, special characters). Analyze how each query handles these edge cases. Ensure that data type differences do not affect the outcome. Verify that constraints (e.g., NOT NULL, UNIQUE) are accounted for.
5. Evaluate Aggregations and Calculations: Confirm that aggregate functions (e.g., SUM, COUNT) are applied identically. Ensure calculations (e.g., subtraction, addition) produce the same results.
6. Check for Logical Equivalence in Conditional Expressions: Compare conditional expressions like IIF, CASE WHEN, and IF. Determine if conditions and returned values are logically the same.
7. Assess Ordering of Results: If ORDER BY clause is present, confirm that both queries order results identically. Recognize that differing order may affect equivalence if result order is significant.
8. Generate a New Logical Equivalence Rule (If Applicable): Create an "Equivalent Queries: <query1>
<query2>
Schema Conditions:<conditions>" statement that defines the equivalence. Use GENERALIZED COLUMN and TABLE NAMES. Specify any necessary conditions based on the database schema. Present the rule clearly, indicating both the equivalence and the conditions under which it holds.



Example Equivalence Rules:

<Rule>
Equivalent Queries:
SELECT c1 from t1 WHERE ...;
SELECT c1 FROM t1 WHERE ...;
Schema Conditions:
None.
</Rule>



# Guidelines:
- Make SURE complete to every step PERFECTLY without ANY Mistakes
- Follow the Rules I Gave you and Remember to AVOID generating repeated equivalence rules in the examples I gave you.
- Be sure to format your response like the example equivalence rules I gave you.
- Put <New Rule></New Rule> around the new equivalence rule that you think of. Do not use other formatting around the equivalent queries.
- Use GENERALIZED COLUMN AND TABLE NAMES in any EQUIVALENCE RULE YOU WRITE. DO NOT USE THE SAME NAMES IN THE PROVIDED QUERY PAIRS!!!!
- If the two queries are not logically equivalent, say <New Rule> Not equivalent </New Rule>.
- If the new equivalence rule is already repeated in the examples listed, say <New Rule> Rule exists </New Rule>.
- The new rule should be be MINIMAL to CLEARLY demonstrate the highlighted semantic difference. Use ellipses to shorten SQL queries where necessary to achieve this.

Take a Deep Breath and Carefully Follow the Rules, Guides and Examples I gave you. I will tip you $2000 if you do EVERYTHING Perfectly.

Your task is to compare the two provided SQL queries on logical equivalence and generate one more equivalence rule in the same format as the provided example equivalence rules.

Please make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please also keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.



Evaluation Criteria:

Logical equivalence - the alignment between the gold SQL query and the machine-generated SQL query. A machine-generated SQL query is logically equivalent to the gold query if these two queries would RETURN THE SAME RESULTS AND IN THE SAME ORDER for ALL POSSIBLE DATABASE INSTANCES that satisfy the provided database schema for these queries. Annotators were asked to penalize machine-generated queries that overlooked edge cases that the gold queries would have caught otherwise.



Evaluation steps:

1. Understand the Database Schema: Identify all tables used in both queries. List all columns referenced, along with their data types and constraints. Determine primary and foreign key relationships. Note any indexes or unique constraints that may affect query execution.
2. Parse and Break Down Each Query: Identify selected columns, functions, and expressions. Note the tables involved and the join conditions. Understand the filtering conditions applied. Identify grouping and aggregate conditions, if any. Determine if result ordering affects equivalence.
3. Compare Query Components: Check if both queries use the same tables and join conditions. Compare filtering conditions in the WHERE clauses. Assess whether the same columns and expressions are selected. Identify if different functions or syntaxes achieve the same result. Look for logical equivalence in expressions and calculations.
4. Consider Edge Cases and Data Variations: Conceptualize sample datasets that include edge cases (e.g., NULL values, zero values, special characters). Analyze how each query handles these edge cases. Ensure that data type differences do not affect the outcome. Verify that constraints (e.g., NOT NULL, UNIQUE) are accounted for.
5. Evaluate Aggregations and Calculations: Confirm that aggregate functions (e.g., SUM, COUNT) are applied identically. Ensure calculations (e.g., subtraction, addition) produce the same results.
6. Check for Logical Equivalence in Conditional Expressions: Compare conditional expressions like IIF, CASE WHEN, and IF. Determine if conditions and returned values are logically the same.
7. Assess Ordering of Results: If ORDER BY clause is present, confirm that both queries order results identically. Recognize that differing order may affect equivalence if result order is significant.
8. Generate a New Logical Equivalence Rule (If Applicable): Create an "Equivalent Queries: <query1>
<query2>
Schema Conditions:<conditions>" statement that defines the equivalence. Use GENERALIZED COLUMN and TABLE NAMES. Specify any necessary conditions based on the database schema. Present the rule clearly, indicating both the equivalence and the conditions under which it holds.



Example Equivalence Rules:

<Rule>
Equivalent Queries:
SELECT c1 from t1 WHERE ...;
SELECT c1 FROM t1 WHERE ...;
Schema Conditions:
None.
</Rule>



# Guidelines:
- Make SURE complete to every step PERFECTLY without ANY Mistakes
- Follow the Rules I Gave you and Remember to AVOID generating repeated equivalence rules in the examples I gave you.
- Be sure to format your response like the example equivalence rules I gave you.
- Put <New Rule></New Rule> around the new equivalence rule that you think of. Do not use other formatting around the equivalent queries.
- Use GENERALIZED COLUMN AND TABLE NAMES in any EQUIVALENCE RULE YOU WRITE. DO NOT USE THE SAME NAMES IN THE PROVIDED QUERY PAIRS!!!!
- If the two queries are not logically equivalent, say <New Rule> Not equivalent </New Rule>.
- If the new equivalence rule is already repeated in the examples listed, say <New Rule> Rule exists </New Rule>.
- The new rule should be be MINIMAL to CLEARLY demonstrate the highlighted semantic difference. Use ellipses to shorten SQL queries where necessary to achieve this.

Take a Deep Breath and Carefully Follow the Rules, Guides and Examples I gave you. I will tip you $2000 if you do EVERYTHING Perfectly.

INFO:root:prompt: You are an expert SQL engineer with 20+ years of experience. You will be given some SQL equivalence rules conditional on some database schemas. You will then be given a pair of SQL queries, consisting of a gold query and a machine-generated query, and a database schema that defines the context of the queries. 

Your task is to compare the two provided SQL queries on logical equivalence and generate one more equivalence rule in the same format as the provided example equivalence rules.

Please make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please also keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.



Evaluation Criteria:

Logical equivalence - the alignment between the gold SQL query and the machine-generated SQL query. A machine-generated SQL query is logically equivalent to the gold query if these two queries would RETURN THE SAME RESULTS AND IN THE SAME ORDER for ALL POSSIBLE DATABASE INSTANCES that satisfy the provided database schema for these queries. Annotators were asked to penalize machine-generated queries that overlooked edge cases that the gold queries would have caught otherwise.



Evaluation steps:

1. Understand the Database Schema: Identify all tables used in both queries. List all columns referenced, along with their data types and constraints. Determine primary and foreign key relationships. Note any indexes or unique constraints that may affect query execution.
2. Parse and Break Down Each Query: Identify selected columns, functions, and expressions. Note the tables involved and the join conditions. Understand the filtering conditions applied. Identify grouping and aggregate conditions, if any. Determine if result ordering affects equivalence.
3. Compare Query Components: Check if both queries use the same tables and join conditions. Compare filtering conditions in the WHERE clauses. Assess whether the same columns and expressions are selected. Identify if different functions or syntaxes achieve the same result. Look for logical equivalence in expressions and calculations.
4. Consider Edge Cases and Data Variations: Conceptualize sample datasets that include edge cases (e.g., NULL values, zero values, special characters). Analyze how each query handles these edge cases. Ensure that data type differences do not affect the outcome. Verify that constraints (e.g., NOT NULL, UNIQUE) are accounted for.
5. Evaluate Aggregations and Calculations: Confirm that aggregate functions (e.g., SUM, COUNT) are applied identically. Ensure calculations (e.g., subtraction, addition) produce the same results.
6. Check for Logical Equivalence in Conditional Expressions: Compare conditional expressions like IIF, CASE WHEN, and IF. Determine if conditions and returned values are logically the same.
7. Assess Ordering of Results: If ORDER BY clause is present, confirm that both queries order results identically. Recognize that differing order may affect equivalence if result order is significant.
8. Generate a New Logical Equivalence Rule (If Applicable): Create an "Equivalent Queries: <query1>
<query2>
Schema Conditions:<conditions>" statement that defines the equivalence. Use GENERALIZED COLUMN and TABLE NAMES. Specify any necessary conditions based on the database schema. Present the rule clearly, indicating both the equivalence and the conditions under which it holds.



Example Equivalence Rules:

<Rule>
Equivalent Queries:
SELECT c1 from t1 WHERE ...;
SELECT c1 FROM t1 WHERE ...;
Schema Conditions:
None.
</Rule>



# Guidelines:
- Make SURE complete to every step PERFECTLY without ANY Mistakes
- Follow the Rules I Gave you and Remember to AVOID generating repeated equivalence rules in the examples I gave you.
- Be sure to format your response like the example equivalence rules I gave you.
- Put <New Rule></New Rule> around the new equivalence rule that you think of. Do not use other formatting around the equivalent queries.
- Use GENERALIZED COLUMN AND TABLE NAMES in any EQUIVALENCE RULE YOU WRITE. DO NOT USE THE SAME NAMES IN THE PROVIDED QUERY PAIRS!!!!
- If the two queries are not logically equivalent, say <New Rule> Not equivalent </New Rule>.
- If the new equivalence rule is already repeated in the examples listed, say <New Rule> Rule exists </New Rule>.
- The new rule should be be MINIMAL to CLEARLY demonstrate the highlighted semantic difference. Use ellipses to shorten SQL queries where necessary to achieve this.

Take a Deep Breath and Carefully Follow the Rules, Guides and Examples I gave you. I will tip you $2000 if you do EVERYTHING Perfectly.

Understand the Database Schema:\n- **Tables Involved**: `event`, `budget`, `expense`\n- **Columns Referenced**:\n  - `event`: `event_id`, `event_name`\n  - `budget`: `budget_id`, `link_to_event`\n  - `expense`: `cost`, `link_to_budget`\n- **Primary and Foreign Keys**:\n  - `event`: `event_id` is the primary key.\n  - `budget`: `budget_id` is the primary key, `link_to_event` is a foreign key referencing `event(event_id)`.\n  - `expense`: `expense_id` is the primary key, `link_to_budget` is a foreign key referencing `budget(budget_id)`.\n- **Constraints**: The foreign keys ensure referential integrity between the tables.\n\n### 2. Parse and Break Down Each Query:\n- **Gold SQL Query**:\n  - Computes the percentage of the total cost for events named 'Yearly Kickoff' relative to the total cost of all events.\n  - Joins `event`, `budget`, and `expense` tables.\n  - Uses `SUM` and `CASE WHEN` to calculate the desired percentage.\n\n- **Machine-generated SQL Query**:\n  - Performs the same computation as the gold query.\n  - The join order is different: starts with `budget`, then joins `expense`, and finally `event`.\n\n### 3. Compare Query Components:\n- Both queries select the same expression: a percentage calculation involving `SUM`, `CASE WHEN`, and `CAST`.\n- The join conditions are logically equivalent, despite the different order of joins.\n- Both queries filter on `event_name` being 'Yearly Kickoff' and use the same logic for the `CASE WHEN` expression.\n\n### 4. Consider Edge Cases and Data Variations:\n- Both queries handle the scenario where no events match the 'Yearly Kickoff' condition by returning 0 due to the `ELSE 0` in the `CASE WHEN`.\n- The handling of `NULL` values in `cost` is consistent, as they would not affect the sum operation.\n\n### 5. Evaluate Aggregations and Calculations:\n- The aggregation functions (`SUM`) and calculations (multiplication and division) are applied identically in both queries.\n\n### 6. Check for Logical Equivalence in Conditional Expressions:\n- The `CASE WHEN` logic is identical in both queries.\n\n### 7. Assess Ordering of Results:\n- No `ORDER BY` clause is present in either query, so result ordering does not affect equivalence.\n\n### 8.

7. Assess Ordering of Results: If ORDER BY clause is present, confirm that both queries order results identically. Recognize that differing order may affect equivalence if result order is significant.
8. Generate a New Logical Equivalence Rule (If Applicable): Create an "Equivalent Queries: <query1>
<query2>
Schema Conditions:<conditions>" statement that defines the equivalence. Use GENERALIZED COLUMN and TABLE NAMES. Specify any necessary conditions based on the database schema. Present the rule clearly, indicating both the equivalence and the conditions under which it holds.



Example Equivalence Rules:

<Rule>
Equivalent Queries:
SELECT c1 from t1 WHERE ...;
SELECT c1 FROM t1 WHERE ...;
Schema Conditions:
None.
</Rule>



# Guidelines:
- Make SURE complete to every step PERFECTLY without ANY Mistakes
- Follow the Rules I Gave you and Remember to AVOID generating repeated equivalence rules in the examples I gave you.
- Be sure to format your response like the example equivalence rules I gave you.
- Put <New Rule></New Rule> around the new equivalence rule that you think of. Do not use other formatting around the equivalent queries.
- Use GENERALIZED COLUMN AND TABLE NAMES in any EQUIVALENCE RULE YOU WRITE. DO NOT USE THE SAME NAMES IN THE PROVIDED QUERY PAIRS!!!!
- If the two queries are not logically equivalent, say <New Rule> Not equivalent </New Rule>.
- If the new equivalence rule is already repeated in the examples listed, say <New Rule> Rule exists </New Rule>.
- The new rule should be be MINIMAL to CLEARLY demonstrate the highlighted semantic difference. Use ellipses to shorten SQL queries where necessary to achieve this.

Take a Deep Breath and Carefully Follow the Rules, Guides and Examples I gave you. I will tip you $2000 if you do EVERYTHING Perfectly.

INFO:root:model: gpt-4o
INFO:root:prompt: You are an expert SQL engineer with 20+ years of experience. You will be given some SQL equivalence rules conditional on some database schemas. You will then be given a pair of SQL queries, consisting of a gold query and a machine-generated query, and a database schema that defines the context of the queries. 

Your task is to compare the two provided SQL queries on logical equivalence and generate one more equivalence rule in the same format as the provided example equivalence rules.

Please make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please also keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.



Evaluation Criteria:

Logical equivalence - the alignment between the gold SQL query and the machine-generated SQL query. A machine-generated SQL query is logically equivalent to the gold query if these two queries would RETURN THE SAME RESULTS AND IN THE SAME ORDER for ALL POSSIBLE DATABASE INSTANCES that satisfy the provided database schema for these queries. Annotators were asked to penalize machine-generated queries that overlooked edge cases that the gold queries would have caught otherwise.



Evaluation steps:

1. Understand the Database Schema: Identify all tables used in both queries. List all columns referenced, along with their data types and constraints. Determine primary and foreign key relationships. Note any indexes or unique constraints that may affect query execution.
2. Parse and Break Down Each Query: Identify selected columns, functions, and expressions. Note the tables involved and the join conditions. Understand the filtering conditions applied. Identify grouping and aggregate conditions, if any. Determine if result ordering affects equivalence.
3. Compare Query Components: Check if both queries use the same tables and join conditions. Compare filtering conditions in the WHERE clauses. Assess whether the same columns and expressions are selected. Identify if different functions or syntaxes achieve the same result. Look for logical equivalence in expressions and calculations.
4. Consider Edge Cases and Data Variations: Conceptualize sample datasets that include edge cases (e.g., NULL values, zero values, special characters). Analyze how each query handles these edge cases. Ensure that data type differences do not affect the outcome. Verify that constraints (e.g., NOT NULL, UNIQUE) are accounted for.
5. Evaluate Aggregations and Calculations: Confirm that aggregate functions (e.g., SUM, COUNT) are applied identically. Ensure calculations (e.g., subtraction, addition) produce the same results.
6. Check for Logical Equivalence in Conditional Expressions: Compare conditional expressions like IIF, CASE WHEN, and IF. Determine if conditions and returned values are logically the same.
7. Assess Ordering of Results: If ORDER BY clause is present, confirm that both queries order results identically. Recognize that differing order may affect equivalence if result order is significant.
8. Generate a New Logical Equivalence Rule (If Applicable): Create an "Equivalent Queries: <query1>
<query2>
Schema Conditions:<conditions>" statement that defines the equivalence. Use GENERALIZED COLUMN and TABLE NAMES. Specify any necessary conditions based on the database schema. Present the rule clearly, indicating both the equivalence and the conditions under which it holds.



Example Equivalence Rules:

<Rule>
Equivalent Queries:
SELECT c1 from t1 WHERE ...;
SELECT c1 FROM t1 WHERE ...;
Schema Conditions:
None.
</Rule>



# Guidelines:
- Make SURE complete to every step PERFECTLY without ANY Mistakes

- Be sure to format your response like the example equivalence rules I gave you.
- Put <New Rule></New Rule> around the new equivalence rule that you think of. Do not use other formatting around the equivalent queries.

INFO:root:prompt: You are an expert SQL engineer with 20+ years of experience. You will be given some SQL equivalence rules conditional on some database schemas. You will then be given a pair of SQL queries, consisting of a gold query and a machine-generated query, and a database schema that defines the context of the queries. 

Your task is to compare the two provided SQL queries on logical equivalence and generate one more equivalence rule in the same format as the provided example equivalence rules.

Please make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please also keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.



Evaluation Criteria:

Logical equivalence - the alignment between the gold SQL query and the machine-generated SQL query. A machine-generated SQL query is logically equivalent to the gold query if these two queries would RETURN THE SAME RESULTS AND IN THE SAME ORDER for ALL POSSIBLE DATABASE INSTANCES that satisfy the provided database schema for these queries. Annotators were asked to penalize machine-generated queries that overlooked edge cases that the gold queries would have caught otherwise.



Evaluation steps:

1. Understand the Database Schema: Identify all tables used in both queries. List all columns referenced, along with their data types and constraints. Determine primary and foreign key relationships. Note any indexes or unique constraints that may affect query execution.
2. Parse and Break Down Each Query: Identify selected columns, functions, and expressions. Note the tables involved and the join conditions. Understand the filtering conditions applied. Identify grouping and aggregate conditions, if any. Determine if result ordering affects equivalence.
3. Compare Query Components: Check if both queries use the same tables and join conditions. Compare filtering conditions in the WHERE clauses. Assess whether the same columns and expressions are selected. Identify if different functions or syntaxes achieve the same result. Look for logical equivalence in expressions and calculations.
4. Consider Edge Cases and Data Variations: Conceptualize sample datasets that include edge cases (e.g., NULL values, zero values, special characters). Analyze how each query handles these edge cases. Ensure that data type differences do not affect the outcome. Verify that constraints (e.g., NOT NULL, UNIQUE) are accounted for.
5. Evaluate Aggregations and Calculations: Confirm that aggregate functions (e.g., SUM, COUNT) are applied identically. Ensure calculations (e.g., subtraction, addition) produce the same results.
6. Check for Logical Equivalence in Conditional Expressions: Compare conditional expressions like IIF, CASE WHEN, and IF. Determine if conditions and returned values are logically the same.
7. Assess Ordering of Results: If ORDER BY clause is present, confirm that both queries order results identically. Recognize that differing order may affect equivalence if result order is significant.
8. Generate a New Logical Equivalence Rule (If Applicable): Create an "Equivalent Queries: <query1>
<query2>
Schema Conditions:<conditions>" statement that defines the equivalence. Use GENERALIZED COLUMN and TABLE NAMES. Specify any necessary conditions based on the database schema. Present the rule clearly, indicating both the equivalence and the conditions under which it holds.



Example Equivalence Rules:

<Rule>
Equivalent Queries:
SELECT c1 from t1 WHERE ...;
SELECT c1 FROM t1 WHERE ...;
Schema Conditions:
None.
</Rule>



# Guidelines:
- Make SURE complete to every step PERFECTLY without ANY Mistakes
- Follow the Rules I Gave you and Remember to AVOID generating repeated equivalence rules in the examples I gave you.
- Be sure to format your response like the example equivalence rules I gave you.
- Put <New Rule></New Rule> around the new equivalence rule that you think of. Do not use other formatting around the equivalent queries.
- Use GENERALIZED COLUMN AND TABLE NAMES in any EQUIVALENCE RULE YOU WRITE. DO NOT USE THE SAME NAMES IN THE PROVIDED QUERY PAIRS!!!!
- If the two queries are not logically equivalent, say <New Rule> Not equivalent </New Rule>.
- If the new equivalence rule is already repeated in the examples listed, say <New Rule> Rule exists </New Rule>.
- The new rule should be be MINIMAL to CLEARLY demonstrate the highlighted semantic difference. Use ellipses to shorten SQL queries where necessary to achieve this.

Thus, the two queries are logically equivalent.\n\n### Step 8: Generate a New Logical Equivalence Rule\n\n<New Rule>\nEquivalent Queries:\nSELECT M.first_name, M.last_name, SUM(E.cost) FROM M INNER JOIN E ON M.id = E.member_id WHERE M.id = 'some_id';\nSELECT M.first_name, M.last_name, SUM(E.cost) FROM M INNER JOIN E ON M.id = E.member_id WHERE E.member_id = 'some_id' GROUP BY M.first_name, M.last_name;\nSchema Conditions:\nNone.\n", role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None, refusal=None))], created=1732077426, model='gpt-4o-2024-08-06', object='chat.completion', system_fingerprint='fp_831e067d82', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=729, prompt_tokens=1544, total_tokens=2273, prompt_tokens_details={'cached_tokens': 0, 'audio_tokens': 0}, completion_tokens_details={'reasoning_tokens': 0, 'audio_tokens': 0, 'accepted_prediction_tokens': 0, 'rejected_prediction_tokens': 0}))

INFO:root:prompt: You are an expert SQL engineer with 20+ years of experience. You will be given some SQL equivalence rules conditional on some database schemas. You will then be given a pair of SQL queries, consisting of a gold query and a machine-generated query, and a database schema that defines the context of the queries. 

Your task is to compare the two provided SQL queries on logical equivalence and generate one more equivalence rule in the same format as the provided example equivalence rules.

Please make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please also keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.



Evaluation Criteria:

Logical equivalence - the alignment between the gold SQL query and the machine-generated SQL query. A machine-generated SQL query is logically equivalent to the gold query if these two queries would RETURN THE SAME RESULTS AND IN THE SAME ORDER for ALL POSSIBLE DATABASE INSTANCES that satisfy the provided database schema for these queries. Annotators were asked to penalize machine-generated queries that overlooked edge cases that the gold queries would have caught otherwise.



Evaluation steps:

1. Understand the Database Schema: Identify all tables used in both queries. List all columns referenced, along with their data types and constraints. Determine primary and foreign key relationships. Note any indexes or unique constraints that may affect query execution.
2. Parse and Break Down Each Query: Identify selected columns, functions, and expressions. Note the tables involved and the join conditions. Understand the filtering conditions applied. Identify grouping and aggregate conditions, if any. Determine if result ordering affects equivalence.
3. Compare Query Components: Check if both queries use the same tables and join conditions. Compare filtering conditions in the WHERE clauses. Assess whether the same columns and expressions are selected. Identify if different functions or syntaxes achieve the same result. Look for logical equivalence in expressions and calculations.
4. Consider Edge Cases and Data Variations: Conceptualize sample datasets that include edge cases (e.g., NULL values, zero values, special characters). Analyze how each query handles these edge cases. Ensure that data type differences do not affect the outcome. Verify that constraints (e.g., NOT NULL, UNIQUE) are accounted for.
5. Evaluate Aggregations and Calculations: Confirm that aggregate functions (e.g., SUM, COUNT) are applied identically. Ensure calculations (e.g., subtraction, addition) produce the same results.
6. Check for Logical Equivalence in Conditional Expressions: Compare conditional expressions like IIF, CASE WHEN, and IF. Determine if conditions and returned values are logically the same.
7. Assess Ordering of Results: If ORDER BY clause is present, confirm that both queries order results identically. Recognize that differing order may affect equivalence if result order is significant.
8. Generate a New Logical Equivalence Rule (If Applicable): Create an "Equivalent Queries: <query1>
<query2>
Schema Conditions:<conditions>" statement that defines the equivalence. Use GENERALIZED COLUMN and TABLE NAMES. Specify any necessary conditions based on the database schema. Present the rule clearly, indicating both the equivalence and the conditions under which it holds.



Example Equivalence Rules:

<Rule>
Equivalent Queries:
SELECT c1 from t1 WHERE ...;
SELECT c1 FROM t1 WHERE ...;
Schema Conditions:
None.
</Rule>



# Guidelines:
- Make SURE complete to every step PERFECTLY without ANY Mistakes
- Follow the Rules I Gave you and Remember to AVOID generating repeated equivalence rules in the examples I gave you.
- Be sure to format your response like the example equivalence rules I gave you.
- Put <New Rule></New Rule> around the new equivalence rule that you think of. Do not use other formatting around the equivalent queries.
- Use GENERALIZED COLUMN AND TABLE NAMES in any EQUIVALENCE RULE YOU WRITE. DO NOT USE THE SAME NAMES IN THE PROVIDED QUERY PAIRS!!!!
- If the two queries are not logically equivalent, say <New Rule> Not equivalent </New Rule>.
- If the new equivalence rule is already repeated in the examples listed, say <New Rule> Rule exists </New Rule>.
- The new rule should be be MINIMAL to CLEARLY demonstrate the highlighted semantic difference. Use ellipses to shorten SQL queries where necessary to achieve this.

Take a Deep Breath and Carefully Follow the Rules, Guides and Examples I gave you. I will tip you $2000 if you do EVERYTHING Perfectly.

INFO:root:prompt: You are an expert SQL engineer with 20+ years of experience. You will be given some SQL equivalence rules conditional on some database schemas. You will then be given a pair of SQL queries, consisting of a gold query and a machine-generated query, and a database schema that defines the context of the queries. 

Your task is to compare the two provided SQL queries on logical equivalence and generate one more equivalence rule in the same format as the provided example equivalence rules.

Please make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please also keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.



Evaluation Criteria:

Logical equivalence - the alignment between the gold SQL query and the machine-generated SQL query. A machine-generated SQL query is logically equivalent to the gold query if these two queries would RETURN THE SAME RESULTS AND IN THE SAME ORDER for ALL POSSIBLE DATABASE INSTANCES that satisfy the provided database schema for these queries. Annotators were asked to penalize machine-generated queries that overlooked edge cases that the gold queries would have caught otherwise.



Evaluation steps:

1. Understand the Database Schema: Identify all tables used in both queries. List all columns referenced, along with their data types and constraints. Determine primary and foreign key relationships. Note any indexes or unique constraints that may affect query execution.
2. Parse and Break Down Each Query: Identify selected columns, functions, and expressions. Note the tables involved and the join conditions. Understand the filtering conditions applied. Identify grouping and aggregate conditions, if any. Determine if result ordering affects equivalence.
3. Compare Query Components: Check if both queries use the same tables and join conditions. Compare filtering conditions in the WHERE clauses. Assess whether the same columns and expressions are selected. Identify if different functions or syntaxes achieve the same result. Look for logical equivalence in expressions and calculations.
4. Consider Edge Cases and Data Variations: Conceptualize sample datasets that include edge cases (e.g., NULL values, zero values, special characters). Analyze how each query handles these edge cases. Ensure that data type differences do not affect the outcome. Verify that constraints (e.g., NOT NULL, UNIQUE) are accounted for.
5. Evaluate Aggregations and Calculations: Confirm that aggregate functions (e.g., SUM, COUNT) are applied identically. Ensure calculations (e.g., subtraction, addition) produce the same results.
6. Check for Logical Equivalence in Conditional Expressions: Compare conditional expressions like IIF, CASE WHEN, and IF. Determine if conditions and returned values are logically the same.
7. Assess Ordering of Results: If ORDER BY clause is present, confirm that both queries order results identically. Recognize that differing order may affect equivalence if result order is significant.
8. Generate a New Logical Equivalence Rule (If Applicable): Create an "Equivalent Queries: <query1>
<query2>
Schema Conditions:<conditions>" statement that defines the equivalence. Use GENERALIZED COLUMN and TABLE NAMES. Specify any necessary conditions based on the database schema. Present the rule clearly, indicating both the equivalence and the conditions under which it holds.



Example Equivalence Rules:

<Rule>
Equivalent Queries:
SELECT c1 from t1 WHERE ...;
SELECT c1 FROM t1 WHERE ...;
Schema Conditions:
None.
</Rule>



# Guidelines:
- Make SURE complete to every step PERFECTLY without ANY Mistakes
- Follow the Rules I Gave you and Remember to AVOID generating repeated equivalence rules in the examples I gave you.
- Be sure to format your response like the example equivalence rules I gave you.
- Put <New Rule></New Rule> around the new equivalence rule that you think of. Do not use other formatting around the equivalent queries.
- Use GENERALIZED COLUMN AND TABLE NAMES in any EQUIVALENCE RULE YOU WRITE. DO NOT USE THE SAME NAMES IN THE PROVIDED QUERY PAIRS!!!!
- If the two queries are not logically equivalent, say <New Rule> Not equivalent </New Rule>.
- If the new equivalence rule is already repeated in the examples listed, say <New Rule> Rule exists </New Rule>.
- The new rule should be be MINIMAL to CLEARLY demonstrate the highlighted semantic difference. Use ellipses to shorten SQL queries where necessary to achieve this.

Both queries will return the same result for all possible database instances that satisfy the provided schema.\n\n### Step 8: Generate a New Logical Equivalence Rule\n\nGiven the analysis, we can generate a new equivalence rule:\n\n<New Rule>\nEquivalent Queries:\nSELECT COUNT(*) FROM t1 INNER JOIN t2 ON t1.c1 = t2.c1 WHERE t1.c2 = 'X' AND STRFTIME('%Y', t2.c3) = 'YYYY' AND t2.c4 = 1;\nSELECT COUNT(t1.c1) FROM t2 INNER JOIN t1 ON t2.c1 = t1.c1 WHERE STRFTIME('%Y', t2.c3) = 'YYYY' AND t2.c4 = 1 AND t1.c2 = 'X';\nSchema Conditions:\nNone.\n", role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None, refusal=None))], created=1732077541, model='gpt-4o-2024-08-06', object='chat.completion', system_fingerprint='fp_831e067d82', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=740, prompt_tokens=1644, total_tokens=2384, prompt_tokens_details={'cached_tokens': 0, 'audio_tokens': 0}, completion_tokens_details={'reasoning_tokens': 0, 'audio_tokens': 0, 'accepted_prediction_tokens': 0, 'rejected_prediction_tokens': 0}))

INFO:root:model: gpt-4o
INFO:root:prompt: You are an expert SQL engineer with 20+ years of experience. You will be given some SQL equivalence rules conditional on some database schemas. You will then be given a pair of SQL queries, consisting of a gold query and a machine-generated query, and a database schema that defines the context of the queries. 

Your task is to compare the two provided SQL queries on logical equivalence and generate one more equivalence rule in the same format as the provided example equivalence rules.

Please make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please also keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.



Evaluation Criteria:

Logical equivalence - the alignment between the gold SQL query and the machine-generated SQL query. A machine-generated SQL query is logically equivalent to the gold query if these two queries would RETURN THE SAME RESULTS AND IN THE SAME ORDER for ALL POSSIBLE DATABASE INSTANCES that satisfy the provided database schema for these queries. Annotators were asked to penalize machine-generated queries that overlooked edge cases that the gold queries would have caught otherwise.



Evaluation steps:

1. Understand the Database Schema: Identify all tables used in both queries. List all columns referenced, along with their data types and constraints. Determine primary and foreign key relationships. Note any indexes or unique constraints that may affect query execution.
2. Parse and Break Down Each Query: Identify selected columns, functions, and expressions. Note the tables involved and the join conditions. Understand the filtering conditions applied. Identify grouping and aggregate conditions, if any. Determine if result ordering affects equivalence.
3. Compare Query Components: Check if both queries use the same tables and join conditions. Compare filtering conditions in the WHERE clauses. Assess whether the same columns and expressions are selected. Identify if different functions or syntaxes achieve the same result. Look for logical equivalence in expressions and calculations.
4. Consider Edge Cases and Data Variations: Conceptualize sample datasets that include edge cases (e.g., NULL values, zero values, special characters). Analyze how each query handles these edge cases. Ensure that data type differences do not affect the outcome. Verify that constraints (e.g., NOT NULL, UNIQUE) are accounted for.
5. Evaluate Aggregations and Calculations: Confirm that aggregate functions (e.g., SUM, COUNT) are applied identically. Ensure calculations (e.g., subtraction, addition) produce the same results.
6. Check for Logical Equivalence in Conditional Expressions: Compare conditional expressions like IIF, CASE WHEN, and IF. Determine if conditions and returned values are logically the same.
7. Assess Ordering of Results: If ORDER BY clause is present, confirm that both queries order results identically. Recognize that differing order may affect equivalence if result order is significant.
8. Generate a New Logical Equivalence Rule (If Applicable): Create an "Equivalent Queries: <query1>
<query2>
Schema Conditions:<conditions>" statement that defines the equivalence. Use GENERALIZED COLUMN and TABLE NAMES. Specify any necessary conditions based on the database schema. Present the rule clearly, indicating both the equivalence and the conditions under which it holds.



Example Equivalence Rules:

<Rule>
Equivalent Queries:
SELECT c1 from t1 WHERE ...;
SELECT c1 FROM t1 WHERE ...;
Schema Conditions:
None.
</Rule>



# Guidelines:
- Make SURE complete to every step PERFECTLY without ANY Mistakes
- Follow the Rules I Gave you and Remember to AVOID generating repeated equivalence rules in the examples I gave you.
- Be sure to format your response like the example equivalence rules I gave you.
- Put <New Rule></New Rule> around the new equivalence rule that you think of. Do not use other formatting around the equivalent queries.
- Use GENERALIZED COLUMN AND TABLE NAMES in any EQUIVALENCE RULE YOU WRITE. DO NOT USE THE SAME NAMES IN THE PROVIDED QUERY PAIRS!!!!
- If the two queries are not logically equivalent, say <New Rule> Not equivalent </New Rule>.
- If the new equivalence rule is already repeated in the examples listed, say <New Rule> Rule exists </New Rule>.
- The new rule should be be MINIMAL to CLEARLY demonstrate the highlighted semantic difference. Use ellipses to shorten SQL queries where necessary to achieve this.

Take a Deep Breath and Carefully Follow the Rules, Guides and Examples I gave you. I will tip you $2000 if you do EVERYTHING Perfectly.

Understand the Database Schema\n\n**Tables Involved:**\n- `Patient`: Contains columns such as `ID`, `SEX`, `Diagnosis`.\n- `Laboratory`: Contains columns such as `ID`, `ALB`, `PLT`.\n\n**Key Relationships:**\n- `Patient.ID` is a primary key.\n- `Laboratory.ID` is part of a composite primary key with `Date` and is a foreign key referencing `Patient.ID`.\n\n### 2. Parse and Break Down Each Query\n\n**Gold SQL Query:**\n- **Selection**: AVG(T2.ALB)\n- **Tables**: Patient (T1), Laboratory (T2)\n- **Join Condition**: T1.ID = T2.ID\n- **Filters**: T2.PLT > 400, T1.Diagnosis = 'SLE', T1.SEX = 'F'\n\n**Machine-generated SQL Query:**\n- **Selection**: avg(laboratory.alb)\n- **Tables**: patient, laboratory\n- **Join Condition**: patient.id = laboratory.id\n- **Filters**: patient.sex = 'F', patient.diagnosis = 'SLE', laboratory.plt > 400\n\n### 3. Compare Query Components\n\n- Both queries use the same tables (`Patient` and `Laboratory`) and the same join condition (`ID` column).\n- The filtering conditions are identical in both queries: filtering by `SEX`, `Diagnosis`, and `PLT` values.\n- The selected column and function (average of `ALB`) are identical.\n\n### 4. Consider Edge Cases and Data Variations\n\n- Both queries handle potential edge cases involving `NULL` values or zero values similarly, given the schema constraints.\n- Data type differences do not affect the outcome as the relevant columns are of compatible types.\n\n### 5. Evaluate Aggregations and Calculations\n\n- The aggregate function `AVG` is applied identically in both queries.\n\n### 6. Check for Logical Equivalence in Conditional Expressions\n\n- The conditional expressions (WHERE clauses) are identical in logic and order.\n\n### 7. Assess Ordering of Results\n\n- Neither query includes an `ORDER BY` clause, so result ordering does not affect equivalence.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBoth the gold and machine-generated queries are logically equivalent, as they would return the same results for any database instance satisfying the provided schema.\n\n### 8.

INFO:root:model: gpt-4o
INFO:root:prompt: You are an expert SQL engineer with 20+ years of experience. You will be given some SQL equivalence rules conditional on some database schemas. You will then be given a pair of SQL queries, consisting of a gold query and a machine-generated query, and a database schema that defines the context of the queries. 

Your task is to compare the two provided SQL queries on logical equivalence and generate one more equivalence rule in the same format as the provided example equivalence rules.

Please make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please also keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.



Evaluation Criteria:

Logical equivalence - the alignment between the gold SQL query and the machine-generated SQL query. A machine-generated SQL query is logically equivalent to the gold query if these two queries would RETURN THE SAME RESULTS AND IN THE SAME ORDER for ALL POSSIBLE DATABASE INSTANCES that satisfy the provided database schema for these queries. Annotators were asked to penalize machine-generated queries that overlooked edge cases that the gold queries would have caught otherwise.



Evaluation steps:

1. Understand the Database Schema: Identify all tables used in both queries. List all columns referenced, along with their data types and constraints. Determine primary and foreign key relationships. Note any indexes or unique constraints that may affect query execution.
2. Parse and Break Down Each Query: Identify selected columns, functions, and expressions. Note the tables involved and the join conditions. Understand the filtering conditions applied. Identify grouping and aggregate conditions, if any. Determine if result ordering affects equivalence.
3. Compare Query Components: Check if both queries use the same tables and join conditions. Compare filtering conditions in the WHERE clauses. Assess whether the same columns and expressions are selected. Identify if different functions or syntaxes achieve the same result. Look for logical equivalence in expressions and calculations.
4. Consider Edge Cases and Data Variations: Conceptualize sample datasets that include edge cases (e.g., NULL values, zero values, special characters). Analyze how each query handles these edge cases. Ensure that data type differences do not affect the outcome. Verify that constraints (e.g., NOT NULL, UNIQUE) are accounted for.
5. Evaluate Aggregations and Calculations: Confirm that aggregate functions (e.g., SUM, COUNT) are applied identically. Ensure calculations (e.g., subtraction, addition) produce the same results.
6. Check for Logical Equivalence in Conditional Expressions: Compare conditional expressions like IIF, CASE WHEN, and IF. Determine if conditions and returned values are logically the same.
7. Assess Ordering of Results: If ORDER BY clause is present, confirm that both queries order results identically. Recognize that differing order may affect equivalence if result order is significant.
8. Generate a New Logical Equivalence Rule (If Applicable): Create an "Equivalent Queries: <query1>
<query2>
Schema Conditions:<conditions>" statement that defines the equivalence. Use GENERALIZED COLUMN and TABLE NAMES. Specify any necessary conditions based on the database schema. Present the rule clearly, indicating both the equivalence and the conditions under which it holds.



Example Equivalence Rules:

<Rule>
Equivalent Queries:
SELECT c1 from t1 WHERE ...;
SELECT c1 FROM t1 WHERE ...;
Schema Conditions:
None.
</Rule>



# Guidelines:
- Make SURE complete to every step PERFECTLY without ANY Mistakes
- Follow the Rules I Gave you and Remember to AVOID generating repeated equivalence rules in the examples I gave you.
- Be sure to format your response like the example equivalence rules I gave you.
- Put <New Rule></New Rule> around the new equivalence rule that you think of. Do not use other formatting around the equivalent queries.
- Use GENERALIZED COLUMN AND TABLE NAMES in any EQUIVALENCE RULE YOU WRITE. DO NOT USE THE SAME NAMES IN THE PROVIDED QUERY PAIRS!!!!
- If the two queries are not logically equivalent, say <New Rule> Not equivalent </New Rule>.
- If the new equivalence rule is already repeated in the examples listed, say <New Rule> Rule exists </New Rule>.
- The new rule should be be MINIMAL to CLEARLY demonstrate the highlighted semantic difference. Use ellipses to shorten SQL queries where necessary to achieve this.

Take a Deep Breath and Carefully Follow the Rules, Guides and Examples I gave you. I will tip you $2000 if you do EVERYTHING Perfectly.

INFO:root:model: gpt-4o
INFO:root:prompt: You are an expert SQL engineer with 20+ years of experience. You will be given some SQL equivalence rules conditional on some database schemas. You will then be given a pair of SQL queries, consisting of a gold query and a machine-generated query, and a database schema that defines the context of the queries. 

Your task is to compare the two provided SQL queries on logical equivalence and generate one more equivalence rule in the same format as the provided example equivalence rules.

Please make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please also keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.



Evaluation Criteria:

Logical equivalence - the alignment between the gold SQL query and the machine-generated SQL query. A machine-generated SQL query is logically equivalent to the gold query if these two queries would RETURN THE SAME RESULTS AND IN THE SAME ORDER for ALL POSSIBLE DATABASE INSTANCES that satisfy the provided database schema for these queries. Annotators were asked to penalize machine-generated queries that overlooked edge cases that the gold queries would have caught otherwise.



Evaluation steps:

1. Understand the Database Schema: Identify all tables used in both queries. List all columns referenced, along with their data types and constraints. Determine primary and foreign key relationships. Note any indexes or unique constraints that may affect query execution.
2. Parse and Break Down Each Query: Identify selected columns, functions, and expressions. Note the tables involved and the join conditions. Understand the filtering conditions applied. Identify grouping and aggregate conditions, if any. Determine if result ordering affects equivalence.
3. Compare Query Components: Check if both queries use the same tables and join conditions. Compare filtering conditions in the WHERE clauses. Assess whether the same columns and expressions are selected. Identify if different functions or syntaxes achieve the same result. Look for logical equivalence in expressions and calculations.
4. Consider Edge Cases and Data Variations: Conceptualize sample datasets that include edge cases (e.g., NULL values, zero values, special characters). Analyze how each query handles these edge cases. Ensure that data type differences do not affect the outcome. Verify that constraints (e.g., NOT NULL, UNIQUE) are accounted for.
5. Evaluate Aggregations and Calculations: Confirm that aggregate functions (e.g., SUM, COUNT) are applied identically. Ensure calculations (e.g., subtraction, addition) produce the same results.
6. Check for Logical Equivalence in Conditional Expressions: Compare conditional expressions like IIF, CASE WHEN, and IF. Determine if conditions and returned values are logically the same.
7. Assess Ordering of Results: If ORDER BY clause is present, confirm that both queries order results identically. Recognize that differing order may affect equivalence if result order is significant.
8. Generate a New Logical Equivalence Rule (If Applicable): Create an "Equivalent Queries: <query1>
<query2>
Schema Conditions:<conditions>" statement that defines the equivalence. Use GENERALIZED COLUMN and TABLE NAMES. Specify any necessary conditions based on the database schema. Present the rule clearly, indicating both the equivalence and the conditions under which it holds.



Example Equivalence Rules:

<Rule>
Equivalent Queries:
SELECT c1 from t1 WHERE ...;
SELECT c1 FROM t1 WHERE ...;
Schema Conditions:
None.
</Rule>



# Guidelines:
- Make SURE complete to every step PERFECTLY without ANY Mistakes
- Follow the Rules I Gave you and Remember to AVOID generating repeated equivalence rules in the examples I gave you.
- Be sure to format your response like the example equivalence rules I gave you.
- Put <New Rule></New Rule> around the new equivalence rule that you think of. Do not use other formatting around the equivalent queries.
- Use GENERALIZED COLUMN AND TABLE NAMES in any EQUIVALENCE RULE YOU WRITE. DO NOT USE THE SAME NAMES IN THE PROVIDED QUERY PAIRS!!!!
- If the two queries are not logically equivalent, say <New Rule> Not equivalent </New Rule>.
- If the new equivalence rule is already repeated in the examples listed, say <New Rule> Rule exists </New Rule>.
- The new rule should be be MINIMAL to CLEARLY demonstrate the highlighted semantic difference. Use ellipses to shorten SQL queries where necessary to achieve this.

Take a Deep Breath and Carefully Follow the Rules, Guides and Examples I gave you. I will tip you $2000 if you do EVERYTHING Perfectly.

</Gold SQL Query>

<Machine-generated SQL Query>

The gold query uses an explicit calculation, while the machine-generated query uses a built-in function.\n\n### Step 6: Check for Logical Equivalence in Conditional Expressions\n- The conditional expressions (filters) are identical.\n\n### Step 7: Assess Ordering of Results\n- No `ORDER BY` clause is present in either query, so result ordering is not a factor.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe machine-generated query is logically equivalent to the gold query. Both queries will return the same result for all possible database instances that satisfy the schema.\n\n### Step 8: Generate a New Logical Equivalence Rule\nSince both queries are logically equivalent, and this specific rule is not listed in the examples, we can create a new rule:\n\n<New Rule>\nEquivalent Queries:\nSELECT CAST(SUM(c2) AS REAL) / COUNT(c3) FROM t1 INNER JOIN t2 ON t1.c1 = t2.c1 WHERE t1.c4 = 'value';\nSELECT AVG(t2.c2) FROM t1 INNER JOIN t2 ON t1.c1 = t2.c1 WHERE t1.c4 = 'value';\nSchema Conditions:\nNone.\n", role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None, refusal=None))], created=1732077628, model='gpt-4o-2024-08-06', object='chat.completion', system_fingerprint='fp_831e067d82', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=807, prompt_tokens=3013, total_tokens=3820, prompt_tokens_details={'cached_tokens': 0, 'audio_tokens': 0}, completion_tokens_details={'reasoning_tokens': 0, 'audio_tokens': 0, 'accepted_prediction_tokens': 0, 'rejected_prediction_tokens': 0}))

INFO:root:model: gpt-4o
INFO:root:prompt: You are an expert SQL engineer with 20+ years of experience. You will be given some SQL equivalence rules conditional on some database schemas. You will then be given a pair of SQL queries, consisting of a gold query and a machine-generated query, and a database schema that defines the context of the queries. 

Your task is to compare the two provided SQL queries on logical equivalence and generate one more equivalence rule in the same format as the provided example equivalence rules.

Please make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please also keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.



Evaluation Criteria:

Logical equivalence - the alignment between the gold SQL query and the machine-generated SQL query. A machine-generated SQL query is logically equivalent to the gold query if these two queries would RETURN THE SAME RESULTS AND IN THE SAME ORDER for ALL POSSIBLE DATABASE INSTANCES that satisfy the provided database schema for these queries. Annotators were asked to penalize machine-generated queries that overlooked edge cases that the gold queries would have caught otherwise.



Evaluation steps:

1. Understand the Database Schema: Identify all tables used in both queries. List all columns referenced, along with their data types and constraints. Determine primary and foreign key relationships. Note any indexes or unique constraints that may affect query execution.
2. Parse and Break Down Each Query: Identify selected columns, functions, and expressions. Note the tables involved and the join conditions. Understand the filtering conditions applied. Identify grouping and aggregate conditions, if any. Determine if result ordering affects equivalence.
3. Compare Query Components: Check if both queries use the same tables and join conditions. Compare filtering conditions in the WHERE clauses. Assess whether the same columns and expressions are selected. Identify if different functions or syntaxes achieve the same result. Look for logical equivalence in expressions and calculations.
4. Consider Edge Cases and Data Variations: Conceptualize sample datasets that include edge cases (e.g., NULL values, zero values, special characters). Analyze how each query handles these edge cases. Ensure that data type differences do not affect the outcome. Verify that constraints (e.g., NOT NULL, UNIQUE) are accounted for.
5. Evaluate Aggregations and Calculations: Confirm that aggregate functions (e.g., SUM, COUNT) are applied identically. Ensure calculations (e.g., subtraction, addition) produce the same results.
6. Check for Logical Equivalence in Conditional Expressions: Compare conditional expressions like IIF, CASE WHEN, and IF. Determine if conditions and returned values are logically the same.
7. Assess Ordering of Results: If ORDER BY clause is present, confirm that both queries order results identically. Recognize that differing order may affect equivalence if result order is significant.
8. Generate a New Logical Equivalence Rule (If Applicable): Create an "Equivalent Queries: <query1>
<query2>
Schema Conditions:<conditions>" statement that defines the equivalence. Use GENERALIZED COLUMN and TABLE NAMES. Specify any necessary conditions based on the database schema. Present the rule clearly, indicating both the equivalence and the conditions under which it holds.



Example Equivalence Rules:

<Rule>
Equivalent Queries:
SELECT c1 from t1 WHERE ...;
SELECT c1 FROM t1 WHERE ...;
Schema Conditions:
None.
</Rule>



# Guidelines:
- Make SURE complete to every step PERFECTLY without ANY Mistakes
- Follow the Rules I Gave you and Remember to AVOID generating repeated equivalence rules in the examples I gave you.
- Be sure to format your response like the example equivalence rules I gave you.
- Put <New Rule></New Rule> around the new equivalence rule that you think of. Do not use other formatting around the equivalent queries.
- Use GENERALIZED COLUMN AND TABLE NAMES in any EQUIVALENCE RULE YOU WRITE. DO NOT USE THE SAME NAMES IN THE PROVIDED QUERY PAIRS!!!!
- If the two queries are not logically equivalent, say <New Rule> Not equivalent </New Rule>.
- If the new equivalence rule is already repeated in the examples listed, say <New Rule> Rule exists </New Rule>.
- The new rule should be be MINIMAL to CLEARLY demonstrate the highlighted semantic difference. Use ellipses to shorten SQL queries where necessary to achieve this.

Take a Deep Breath and Carefully Follow the Rules, Guides and Examples I gave you. I will tip you $2000 if you do EVERYTHING Perfectly.

INFO:root:model: gpt-4o
INFO:root:prompt: You are an expert SQL engineer with 20+ years of experience. You will be given some SQL equivalence rules conditional on some database schemas. You will then be given a pair of SQL queries, consisting of a gold query and a machine-generated query, and a database schema that defines the context of the queries. 

Your task is to compare the two provided SQL queries on logical equivalence and generate one more equivalence rule in the same format as the provided example equivalence rules.

Please make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please also keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.



Evaluation Criteria:

Logical equivalence - the alignment between the gold SQL query and the machine-generated SQL query. A machine-generated SQL query is logically equivalent to the gold query if these two queries would RETURN THE SAME RESULTS AND IN THE SAME ORDER for ALL POSSIBLE DATABASE INSTANCES that satisfy the provided database schema for these queries. Annotators were asked to penalize machine-generated queries that overlooked edge cases that the gold queries would have caught otherwise.



Evaluation steps:

1. Understand the Database Schema: Identify all tables used in both queries. List all columns referenced, along with their data types and constraints. Determine primary and foreign key relationships. Note any indexes or unique constraints that may affect query execution.
2. Parse and Break Down Each Query: Identify selected columns, functions, and expressions. Note the tables involved and the join conditions. Understand the filtering conditions applied. Identify grouping and aggregate conditions, if any. Determine if result ordering affects equivalence.
3. Compare Query Components: Check if both queries use the same tables and join conditions. Compare filtering conditions in the WHERE clauses. Assess whether the same columns and expressions are selected. Identify if different functions or syntaxes achieve the same result. Look for logical equivalence in expressions and calculations.
4. Consider Edge Cases and Data Variations: Conceptualize sample datasets that include edge cases (e.g., NULL values, zero values, special characters). Analyze how each query handles these edge cases. Ensure that data type differences do not affect the outcome. Verify that constraints (e.g., NOT NULL, UNIQUE) are accounted for.
5. Evaluate Aggregations and Calculations: Confirm that aggregate functions (e.g., SUM, COUNT) are applied identically. Ensure calculations (e.g., subtraction, addition) produce the same results.
6. Check for Logical Equivalence in Conditional Expressions: Compare conditional expressions like IIF, CASE WHEN, and IF. Determine if conditions and returned values are logically the same.
7. Assess Ordering of Results: If ORDER BY clause is present, confirm that both queries order results identically. Recognize that differing order may affect equivalence if result order is significant.
8. Generate a New Logical Equivalence Rule (If Applicable): Create an "Equivalent Queries: <query1>
<query2>
Schema Conditions:<conditions>" statement that defines the equivalence. Use GENERALIZED COLUMN and TABLE NAMES. Specify any necessary conditions based on the database schema. Present the rule clearly, indicating both the equivalence and the conditions under which it holds.



Example Equivalence Rules:

<Rule>
Equivalent Queries:
SELECT c1 from t1 WHERE ...;
SELECT c1 FROM t1 WHERE ...;
Schema Conditions:
None.
</Rule>



# Guidelines:
- Make SURE complete to every step PERFECTLY without ANY Mistakes
- Follow the Rules I Gave you and Remember to AVOID generating repeated equivalence rules in the examples I gave you.
- Be sure to format your response like the example equivalence rules I gave you.
- Put <New Rule></New Rule> around the new equivalence rule that you think of. Do not use other formatting around the equivalent queries.
- Use GENERALIZED COLUMN AND TABLE NAMES in any EQUIVALENCE RULE YOU WRITE. DO NOT USE THE SAME NAMES IN THE PROVIDED QUERY PAIRS!!!!
- If the two queries are not logically equivalent, say <New Rule> Not equivalent </New Rule>.
- If the new equivalence rule is already repeated in the examples listed, say <New Rule> Rule exists </New Rule>.
- The new rule should be be MINIMAL to CLEARLY demonstrate the highlighted semantic difference. Use ellipses to shorten SQL queries where necessary to achieve this.

Take a Deep Breath and Carefully Follow the Rules, Guides and Examples I gave you. I will tip you $2000 if you do EVERYTHING Perfectly.

INFO:root:model: gpt-4o
INFO:root:prompt: You are an expert SQL engineer with 20+ years of experience. You will be given some SQL equivalence rules conditional on some database schemas. You will then be given a pair of SQL queries, consisting of a gold query and a machine-generated query, and a database schema that defines the context of the queries. 

Your task is to compare the two provided SQL queries on logical equivalence and generate one more equivalence rule in the same format as the provided example equivalence rules.

Please make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please also keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.



Evaluation Criteria:

Logical equivalence - the alignment between the gold SQL query and the machine-generated SQL query. A machine-generated SQL query is logically equivalent to the gold query if these two queries would RETURN THE SAME RESULTS AND IN THE SAME ORDER for ALL POSSIBLE DATABASE INSTANCES that satisfy the provided database schema for these queries. Annotators were asked to penalize machine-generated queries that overlooked edge cases that the gold queries would have caught otherwise.



Evaluation steps:

1. Understand the Database Schema: Identify all tables used in both queries. List all columns referenced, along with their data types and constraints. Determine primary and foreign key relationships. Note any indexes or unique constraints that may affect query execution.
2. Parse and Break Down Each Query: Identify selected columns, functions, and expressions. Note the tables involved and the join conditions. Understand the filtering conditions applied. Identify grouping and aggregate conditions, if any. Determine if result ordering affects equivalence.
3. Compare Query Components: Check if both queries use the same tables and join conditions. Compare filtering conditions in the WHERE clauses. Assess whether the same columns and expressions are selected. Identify if different functions or syntaxes achieve the same result. Look for logical equivalence in expressions and calculations.
4. Consider Edge Cases and Data Variations: Conceptualize sample datasets that include edge cases (e.g., NULL values, zero values, special characters). Analyze how each query handles these edge cases. Ensure that data type differences do not affect the outcome. Verify that constraints (e.g., NOT NULL, UNIQUE) are accounted for.
5. Evaluate Aggregations and Calculations: Confirm that aggregate functions (e.g., SUM, COUNT) are applied identically. Ensure calculations (e.g., subtraction, addition) produce the same results.
6. Check for Logical Equivalence in Conditional Expressions: Compare conditional expressions like IIF, CASE WHEN, and IF. Determine if conditions and returned values are logically the same.
7. Assess Ordering of Results: If ORDER BY clause is present, confirm that both queries order results identically. Recognize that differing order may affect equivalence if result order is significant.
8. Generate a New Logical Equivalence Rule (If Applicable): Create an "Equivalent Queries: <query1>
<query2>
Schema Conditions:<conditions>" statement that defines the equivalence. Use GENERALIZED COLUMN and TABLE NAMES. Specify any necessary conditions based on the database schema. Present the rule clearly, indicating both the equivalence and the conditions under which it holds.



Example Equivalence Rules:

<Rule>
Equivalent Queries:
SELECT c1 from t1 WHERE ...;
SELECT c1 FROM t1 WHERE ...;
Schema Conditions:
None.
</Rule>



# Guidelines:
- Make SURE complete to every step PERFECTLY without ANY Mistakes
- Follow the Rules I Gave you and Remember to AVOID generating repeated equivalence rules in the examples I gave you.
- Be sure to format your response like the example equivalence rules I gave you.
- Put <New Rule></New Rule> around the new equivalence rule that you think of. Do not use other formatting around the equivalent queries.
- Use GENERALIZED COLUMN AND TABLE NAMES in any EQUIVALENCE RULE YOU WRITE. DO NOT USE THE SAME NAMES IN THE PROVIDED QUERY PAIRS!!!!
- If the two queries are not logically equivalent, say <New Rule> Not equivalent </New Rule>.
- If the new equivalence rule is already repeated in the examples listed, say <New Rule> Rule exists </New Rule>.
- The new rule should be be MINIMAL to CLEARLY demonstrate the highlighted semantic difference. Use ellipses to shorten SQL queries where necessary to achieve this.

Take a Deep Breath and Carefully Follow the Rules, Guides and Examples I gave you. I will tip you $2000 if you do EVERYTHING Perfectly.



Pair of SQL Queries:
<Gold SQL Query>
SELECT CAST(SUM(t2.home_team_goal) AS REAL) / COUNT(t2.id) FROM Country AS t1 INNER JOIN Match AS t2 ON t1.id = t2.country_id WHERE t1.name = 'Poland' AND t2.season = '2010/2011';
</Gold SQL Query>

<Machine-generated SQL Query>
SELECT avg(match.home_team_goal) FROM match INNER JOIN country ON match.country_id = country.id WHERE country.name = 'Poland' AND match.season = '2010/2011';
</Machine-generated SQL Query>

AS REAL) / COUNT(...)`, while the machine-generated query uses `AVG(...)`. Both approaches will yield the same result for average calculation.\n\n### Step 4: Consider Edge Cases and Data Variations\n\n- Both queries handle NULL values in `home_team_goal` similarly, as `AVG` and `SUM`/`COUNT` ignore NULLs.\n- Data type differences do not affect the outcome since both queries result in a REAL type average.\n\n### Step 5: Evaluate Aggregations and Calculations\n\n- Both queries achieve the same result using different methods for calculating the average.\n\n### Step 6: Check for Logical Equivalence in Conditional Expressions\n\n- There are no conditional expressions like IIF, CASE WHEN, or IF used here.\n\n### Step 7: Assess Ordering of Results\n\n- There is no ORDER BY clause in either query, so result ordering is not a factor.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe machine-generated query is logically equivalent to the gold query. They both calculate the average `home_team_goal` for matches played in Poland during the 2010/2011 season.\n\n### Step 8: Generate a New Logical Equivalence Rule\n\n<New Rule>\nEquivalent Queries:\nSELECT CAST(SUM(t1.c1) AS REAL) / COUNT(t1.c2) FROM t2 INNER JOIN t1 ON t2.c3 = t1.c4 WHERE t2.c5 = '...'

INFO:root:model: gpt-4o
INFO:root:prompt: You are an expert SQL engineer with 20+ years of experience. You will be given some SQL equivalence rules conditional on some database schemas. You will then be given a pair of SQL queries, consisting of a gold query and a machine-generated query, and a database schema that defines the context of the queries. 

Your task is to compare the two provided SQL queries on logical equivalence and generate one more equivalence rule in the same format as the provided example equivalence rules.

Please make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please also keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.



Evaluation Criteria:

Logical equivalence - the alignment between the gold SQL query and the machine-generated SQL query. A machine-generated SQL query is logically equivalent to the gold query if these two queries would RETURN THE SAME RESULTS AND IN THE SAME ORDER for ALL POSSIBLE DATABASE INSTANCES that satisfy the provided database schema for these queries. Annotators were asked to penalize machine-generated queries that overlooked edge cases that the gold queries would have caught otherwise.



Evaluation steps:

1. Understand the Database Schema: Identify all tables used in both queries. List all columns referenced, along with their data types and constraints. Determine primary and foreign key relationships. Note any indexes or unique constraints that may affect query execution.
2. Parse and Break Down Each Query: Identify selected columns, functions, and expressions. Note the tables involved and the join conditions. Understand the filtering conditions applied. Identify grouping and aggregate conditions, if any. Determine if result ordering affects equivalence.
3. Compare Query Components: Check if both queries use the same tables and join conditions. Compare filtering conditions in the WHERE clauses. Assess whether the same columns and expressions are selected. Identify if different functions or syntaxes achieve the same result. Look for logical equivalence in expressions and calculations.
4. Consider Edge Cases and Data Variations: Conceptualize sample datasets that include edge cases (e.g., NULL values, zero values, special characters). Analyze how each query handles these edge cases. Ensure that data type differences do not affect the outcome. Verify that constraints (e.g., NOT NULL, UNIQUE) are accounted for.
5. Evaluate Aggregations and Calculations: Confirm that aggregate functions (e.g., SUM, COUNT) are applied identically. Ensure calculations (e.g., subtraction, addition) produce the same results.
6. Check for Logical Equivalence in Conditional Expressions: Compare conditional expressions like IIF, CASE WHEN, and IF. Determine if conditions and returned values are logically the same.
7. Assess Ordering of Results: If ORDER BY clause is present, confirm that both queries order results identically. Recognize that differing order may affect equivalence if result order is significant.
8. Generate a New Logical Equivalence Rule (If Applicable): Create an "Equivalent Queries: <query1>
<query2>
Schema Conditions:<conditions>" statement that defines the equivalence. Use GENERALIZED COLUMN and TABLE NAMES. Specify any necessary conditions based on the database schema. Present the rule clearly, indicating both the equivalence and the conditions under which it holds.



Example Equivalence Rules:

<Rule>
Equivalent Queries:
SELECT c1 from t1 WHERE ...;
SELECT c1 FROM t1 WHERE ...;
Schema Conditions:
None.
</Rule>



# Guidelines:
- Make SURE complete to every step PERFECTLY without ANY Mistakes
- Follow the Rules I Gave you and Remember to AVOID generating repeated equivalence rules in the examples I gave you.
- Be sure to format your response like the example equivalence rules I gave you.
- Put <New Rule></New Rule> around the new equivalence rule that you think of. Do not use other formatting around the equivalent queries.
- Use GENERALIZED COLUMN AND TABLE NAMES in any EQUIVALENCE RULE YOU WRITE. DO NOT USE THE SAME NAMES IN THE PROVIDED QUERY PAIRS!!!!
- If the two queries are not logically equivalent, say <New Rule> Not equivalent </New Rule>.
- If the new equivalence rule is already repeated in the examples listed, say <New Rule> Rule exists </New Rule>.
- The new rule should be be MINIMAL to CLEARLY demonstrate the highlighted semantic difference. Use ellipses to shorten SQL queries where necessary to achieve this.

Take a Deep Breath and Carefully Follow the Rules, Guides and Examples I gave you. I will tip you $2000 if you do EVERYTHING Perfectly.



Pair of SQL Queries:
<Gold SQL Query>
SELECT player_name FROM Player ORDER BY height DESC LIMIT 1;
</Gold SQL Query>

<Machine-generated SQL Query>
SELECT player_name FROM player ORDER BY height DESC LIMIT 1;

INFO:root:model: gpt-4o
INFO:root:prompt: You are an expert SQL engineer with 20+ years of experience. You will be given some SQL equivalence rules conditional on some database schemas. You will then be given a pair of SQL queries, consisting of a gold query and a machine-generated query, and a database schema that defines the context of the queries. 

Your task is to compare the two provided SQL queries on logical equivalence and generate one more equivalence rule in the same format as the provided example equivalence rules.

Please make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please also keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.



Evaluation Criteria:

Logical equivalence - the alignment between the gold SQL query and the machine-generated SQL query. A machine-generated SQL query is logically equivalent to the gold query if these two queries would RETURN THE SAME RESULTS AND IN THE SAME ORDER for ALL POSSIBLE DATABASE INSTANCES that satisfy the provided database schema for these queries. Annotators were asked to penalize machine-generated queries that overlooked edge cases that the gold queries would have caught otherwise.



Evaluation steps:

1. Understand the Database Schema: Identify all tables used in both queries. List all columns referenced, along with their data types and constraints. Determine primary and foreign key relationships. Note any indexes or unique constraints that may affect query execution.
2. Parse and Break Down Each Query: Identify selected columns, functions, and expressions. Note the tables involved and the join conditions. Understand the filtering conditions applied. Identify grouping and aggregate conditions, if any. Determine if result ordering affects equivalence.
3. Compare Query Components: Check if both queries use the same tables and join conditions. Compare filtering conditions in the WHERE clauses. Assess whether the same columns and expressions are selected. Identify if different functions or syntaxes achieve the same result. Look for logical equivalence in expressions and calculations.
4. Consider Edge Cases and Data Variations: Conceptualize sample datasets that include edge cases (e.g., NULL values, zero values, special characters). Analyze how each query handles these edge cases. Ensure that data type differences do not affect the outcome. Verify that constraints (e.g., NOT NULL, UNIQUE) are accounted for.
5. Evaluate Aggregations and Calculations: Confirm that aggregate functions (e.g., SUM, COUNT) are applied identically. Ensure calculations (e.g., subtraction, addition) produce the same results.
6. Check for Logical Equivalence in Conditional Expressions: Compare conditional expressions like IIF, CASE WHEN, and IF. Determine if conditions and returned values are logically the same.
7. Assess Ordering of Results: If ORDER BY clause is present, confirm that both queries order results identically. Recognize that differing order may affect equivalence if result order is significant.
8. Generate a New Logical Equivalence Rule (If Applicable): Create an "Equivalent Queries: <query1>
<query2>
Schema Conditions:<conditions>" statement that defines the equivalence. Use GENERALIZED COLUMN and TABLE NAMES. Specify any necessary conditions based on the database schema. Present the rule clearly, indicating both the equivalence and the conditions under which it holds.



Example Equivalence Rules:

<Rule>
Equivalent Queries:
SELECT c1 from t1 WHERE ...;
SELECT c1 FROM t1 WHERE ...;
Schema Conditions:
None.
</Rule>



# Guidelines:
- Make SURE complete to every step PERFECTLY without ANY Mistakes
- Follow the Rules I Gave you and Remember to AVOID generating repeated equivalence rules in the examples I gave you.
- Be sure to format your response like the example equivalence rules I gave you.
- Put <New Rule></New Rule> around the new equivalence rule that you think of. Do not use other formatting around the equivalent queries.
- Use GENERALIZED COLUMN AND TABLE NAMES in any EQUIVALENCE RULE YOU WRITE. DO NOT USE THE SAME NAMES IN THE PROVIDED QUERY PAIRS!!!!
- If the two queries are not logically equivalent, say <New Rule> Not equivalent </New Rule>.
- If the new equivalence rule is already repeated in the examples listed, say <New Rule> Rule exists </New Rule>.
- The new rule should be be MINIMAL to CLEARLY demonstrate the highlighted semantic difference. Use ellipses to shorten SQL queries where necessary to achieve this.

Take a Deep Breath and Carefully Follow the Rules, Guides and Examples I gave you. I will tip you $2000 if you do EVERYTHING Perfectly.

Both will match the same set of dates starting with '2009-04'.\n\n### Step 5: Evaluate Aggregations and Calculations\n\n- Both queries apply the `COUNT` function to `Match.id`, which is identical in both queries.\n\n### Step 6: Check for Logical Equivalence in Conditional Expressions\n\n- The conditional expressions are logically equivalent as explained in Step 4.\n\n### Step 7: Assess Ordering of Results\n\n- Neither query specifies an `ORDER BY` clause, so result ordering does not affect equivalence.\n\n### Step 8: Generate a New Logical Equivalence Rule\n\nGiven the analysis, the two queries are logically equivalent. The equivalence is primarily due to the use of `SUBSTR` vs. `LIKE` for date filtering, which are equivalent in this context.\n\n<New Rule>\nEquivalent Queries:\nSELECT COUNT(c1) FROM t2 INNER JOIN t1 ON t2.c3 = t1.c1 WHERE t1.c2 = 'value' AND SUBSTR(t2.c4, 1, 7) = 'YYYY-MM';\nSELECT COUNT(c1) FROM t2 INNER JOIN t1 ON t2.c3 = t1.c1 WHERE t1.c2 = 'value' AND t2.c4 LIKE 'YYYY-MM%';\nSchema Conditions:\nNone.\n", role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None, refusal=None))], created=1732077768, model='gpt-4o-2024-08-06', object='chat.completion', system_fingerprint='fp_831e067d82', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=678, prompt_tokens=3020, total_tokens=3698, prompt_tokens_details={'cached_tokens': 0, 'audio_tokens': 0}, completion_tokens_details={'reasoning_tokens': 0, 'audio_tokens': 0, 'accepted_prediction_tokens': 0, 'rejected_prediction_tokens': 0}))

INFO:root:model: gpt-4o
INFO:root:prompt: You are an expert SQL engineer with 20+ years of experience. You will be given some SQL equivalence rules conditional on some database schemas. You will then be given a pair of SQL queries, consisting of a gold query and a machine-generated query, and a database schema that defines the context of the queries. 

Your task is to compare the two provided SQL queries on logical equivalence and generate one more equivalence rule in the same format as the provided example equivalence rules.

Please make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please also keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.



Evaluation Criteria:

Logical equivalence - the alignment between the gold SQL query and the machine-generated SQL query. A machine-generated SQL query is logically equivalent to the gold query if these two queries would RETURN THE SAME RESULTS AND IN THE SAME ORDER for ALL POSSIBLE DATABASE INSTANCES that satisfy the provided database schema for these queries. Annotators were asked to penalize machine-generated queries that overlooked edge cases that the gold queries would have caught otherwise.



Evaluation steps:

1. Understand the Database Schema: Identify all tables used in both queries. List all columns referenced, along with their data types and constraints. Determine primary and foreign key relationships. Note any indexes or unique constraints that may affect query execution.
2. Parse and Break Down Each Query: Identify selected columns, functions, and expressions. Note the tables involved and the join conditions. Understand the filtering conditions applied. Identify grouping and aggregate conditions, if any. Determine if result ordering affects equivalence.
3. Compare Query Components: Check if both queries use the same tables and join conditions. Compare filtering conditions in the WHERE clauses. Assess whether the same columns and expressions are selected. Identify if different functions or syntaxes achieve the same result. Look for logical equivalence in expressions and calculations.
4. Consider Edge Cases and Data Variations: Conceptualize sample datasets that include edge cases (e.g., NULL values, zero values, special characters). Analyze how each query handles these edge cases. Ensure that data type differences do not affect the outcome. Verify that constraints (e.g., NOT NULL, UNIQUE) are accounted for.
5. Evaluate Aggregations and Calculations: Confirm that aggregate functions (e.g., SUM, COUNT) are applied identically. Ensure calculations (e.g., subtraction, addition) produce the same results.
6. Check for Logical Equivalence in Conditional Expressions: Compare conditional expressions like IIF, CASE WHEN, and IF. Determine if conditions and returned values are logically the same.
7. Assess Ordering of Results: If ORDER BY clause is present, confirm that both queries order results identically. Recognize that differing order may affect equivalence if result order is significant.
8. Generate a New Logical Equivalence Rule (If Applicable): Create an "Equivalent Queries: <query1>
<query2>
Schema Conditions:<conditions>" statement that defines the equivalence. Use GENERALIZED COLUMN and TABLE NAMES. Specify any necessary conditions based on the database schema. Present the rule clearly, indicating both the equivalence and the conditions under which it holds.



Example Equivalence Rules:

<Rule>
Equivalent Queries:
SELECT c1 from t1 WHERE ...;
SELECT c1 FROM t1 WHERE ...;
Schema Conditions:
None.
</Rule>



# Guidelines:
- Make SURE complete to every step PERFECTLY without ANY Mistakes
- Follow the Rules I Gave you and Remember to AVOID generating repeated equivalence rules in the examples I gave you.
- Be sure to format your response like the example equivalence rules I gave you.
- Put <New Rule></New Rule> around the new equivalence rule that you think of. Do not use other formatting around the equivalent queries.
- Use GENERALIZED COLUMN AND TABLE NAMES in any EQUIVALENCE RULE YOU WRITE. DO NOT USE THE SAME NAMES IN THE PROVIDED QUERY PAIRS!!!!
- If the two queries are not logically equivalent, say <New Rule> Not equivalent </New Rule>.
- If the new equivalence rule is already repeated in the examples listed, say <New Rule> Rule exists </New Rule>.
- The new rule should be be MINIMAL to CLEARLY demonstrate the highlighted semantic difference. Use ellipses to shorten SQL queries where necessary to achieve this.

Take a Deep Breath and Carefully Follow the Rules, Guides and Examples I gave you. I will tip you $2000 if you do EVERYTHING Perfectly.

The gold query uses `* 1.0` to ensure floating-point division, while the machine-generated query uses `CAST` to `REAL`.\n- **NULL Handling**: Both queries assume no NULL values in the sum expressions, which is reasonable given the schema.\n\n### Step 5: Evaluate Aggregations and Calculations\n\n- Both queries use `SUM` and arithmetic operations similarly.\n- The difference is in ensuring floating-point arithmetic: the gold query uses `* 1.0`, while the machine-generated query uses `CAST`.\n\n### Step 6: Check for Logical Equivalence in Conditional Expressions\n\n- Both queries use `CASE WHEN` identically for conditional aggregation.\n\n### Step 7: Assess Ordering of Results\n\n- No `ORDER BY` clause is present, so result ordering is not a factor.\n\n### Conclusion: Logical Equivalence\n\nThe two queries are logically equivalent as they achieve the same result using slightly different methods to ensure floating-point arithmetic.\n\n### Step 8: Generate a New Logical Equivalence Rule\n\nGiven the analysis, we can define a new equivalence rule:\n\n<New Rule>\nEquivalent Queries:\nSELECT (SUM(CASE WHEN t1.c1 = 'value1' THEN t2.c2 ELSE 0 END) * 1.0 - SUM(CASE WHEN t1.c1 = 'value2' THEN t2.c2 ELSE 0 END)) * 100 / SUM(CASE WHEN t1.c1 = 'value2' THEN t2.c2 ELSE 0 END) FROM t1 INNER JOIN t2 ON t1.c3 = t2.c3;\nSELECT CAST((SUM(CASE WHEN t1.c1 = 'value1' THEN t2.c2 ELSE 0 END) - SUM(CASE WHEN t1.c1 = 'value2' THEN t2.c2 ELSE 0 END)) AS REAL) * 100 / SUM(CASE WHEN t1.c1 = 'value2' THEN t2.c2 ELSE 0 END) FROM t1 INNER JOIN t2 ON t1.c3 = t2.c3;\nSchema Conditions:\nNone.\n", role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None, refusal=None))], created=1732077787, model='gpt-4o-2024-08-06', object='chat.completion', system_fingerprint='fp_831e067d82', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=1087, prompt_tokens=3142, total_tokens=4229, prompt_tokens_details={'cached_tokens': 0, 'audio_tokens': 0}, completion_tokens_details={'reasoning_tokens': 0, 'audio_tokens': 0, 'accepted_prediction_tokens': 0, 'rejected_prediction_tokens': 0}))

INFO:root:model: gpt-4o
INFO:root:prompt: You are an expert SQL engineer with 20+ years of experience. You will be given some SQL equivalence rules conditional on some database schemas. You will then be given a pair of SQL queries, consisting of a gold query and a machine-generated query, and a database schema that defines the context of the queries. 

Your task is to compare the two provided SQL queries on logical equivalence and generate one more equivalence rule in the same format as the provided example equivalence rules.

Please make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please also keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.



Evaluation Criteria:

Logical equivalence - the alignment between the gold SQL query and the machine-generated SQL query. A machine-generated SQL query is logically equivalent to the gold query if these two queries would RETURN THE SAME RESULTS AND IN THE SAME ORDER for ALL POSSIBLE DATABASE INSTANCES that satisfy the provided database schema for these queries. Annotators were asked to penalize machine-generated queries that overlooked edge cases that the gold queries would have caught otherwise.



Evaluation steps:

1. Understand the Database Schema: Identify all tables used in both queries. List all columns referenced, along with their data types and constraints. Determine primary and foreign key relationships. Note any indexes or unique constraints that may affect query execution.
2. Parse and Break Down Each Query: Identify selected columns, functions, and expressions. Note the tables involved and the join conditions. Understand the filtering conditions applied. Identify grouping and aggregate conditions, if any. Determine if result ordering affects equivalence.
3. Compare Query Components: Check if both queries use the same tables and join conditions. Compare filtering conditions in the WHERE clauses. Assess whether the same columns and expressions are selected. Identify if different functions or syntaxes achieve the same result. Look for logical equivalence in expressions and calculations.
4. Consider Edge Cases and Data Variations: Conceptualize sample datasets that include edge cases (e.g., NULL values, zero values, special characters). Analyze how each query handles these edge cases. Ensure that data type differences do not affect the outcome. Verify that constraints (e.g., NOT NULL, UNIQUE) are accounted for.
5. Evaluate Aggregations and Calculations: Confirm that aggregate functions (e.g., SUM, COUNT) are applied identically. Ensure calculations (e.g., subtraction, addition) produce the same results.
6. Check for Logical Equivalence in Conditional Expressions: Compare conditional expressions like IIF, CASE WHEN, and IF. Determine if conditions and returned values are logically the same.
7. Assess Ordering of Results: If ORDER BY clause is present, confirm that both queries order results identically. Recognize that differing order may affect equivalence if result order is significant.
8. Generate a New Logical Equivalence Rule (If Applicable): Create an "Equivalent Queries: <query1>
<query2>
Schema Conditions:<conditions>" statement that defines the equivalence. Use GENERALIZED COLUMN and TABLE NAMES. Specify any necessary conditions based on the database schema. Present the rule clearly, indicating both the equivalence and the conditions under which it holds.



Example Equivalence Rules:

<Rule>
Equivalent Queries:
SELECT c1 from t1 WHERE ...;
SELECT c1 FROM t1 WHERE ...;
Schema Conditions:
None.
</Rule>



# Guidelines:
- Make SURE complete to every step PERFECTLY without ANY Mistakes
- Follow the Rules I Gave you and Remember to AVOID generating repeated equivalence rules in the examples I gave you.
- Be sure to format your response like the example equivalence rules I gave you.
- Put <New Rule></New Rule> around the new equivalence rule that you think of. Do not use other formatting around the equivalent queries.
- Use GENERALIZED COLUMN AND TABLE NAMES in any EQUIVALENCE RULE YOU WRITE. DO NOT USE THE SAME NAMES IN THE PROVIDED QUERY PAIRS!!!!
- If the two queries are not logically equivalent, say <New Rule> Not equivalent </New Rule>.
- If the new equivalence rule is already repeated in the examples listed, say <New Rule> Rule exists </New Rule>.
- The new rule should be be MINIMAL to CLEARLY demonstrate the highlighted semantic difference. Use ellipses to shorten SQL queries where necessary to achieve this.

Take a Deep Breath and Carefully Follow the Rules, Guides and Examples I gave you. I will tip you $2000 if you do EVERYTHING Perfectly.



Pair of SQL Queries:
<Gold SQL Query>
SELECT CAST(SUM(t2.overall_rating) AS REAL) / COUNT(t2.id) FROM Player AS t1 INNER JOIN Player_Attributes AS t2 ON t1.player_api_id = t2.player_api_id WHERE t1.player_name = 'Pietro Marino';
</Gold SQL Query>

<Machine-generated SQL Query>
SELECT avg(player_attributes.overall_rating) FROM player INNER JOIN player_attributes ON player.player_api_id = player_attributes.player_api_id WHERE player.player_name = 'Pietro Marino';
</Machine-generated SQL Query>

INFO:root:model: gpt-4o
INFO:root:prompt: You are an expert SQL engineer with 20+ years of experience. You will be given some SQL equivalence rules conditional on some database schemas. You will then be given a pair of SQL queries, consisting of a gold query and a machine-generated query, and a database schema that defines the context of the queries. 

Your task is to compare the two provided SQL queries on logical equivalence and generate one more equivalence rule in the same format as the provided example equivalence rules.

Please make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please also keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.



Evaluation Criteria:

Logical equivalence - the alignment between the gold SQL query and the machine-generated SQL query. A machine-generated SQL query is logically equivalent to the gold query if these two queries would RETURN THE SAME RESULTS AND IN THE SAME ORDER for ALL POSSIBLE DATABASE INSTANCES that satisfy the provided database schema for these queries. Annotators were asked to penalize machine-generated queries that overlooked edge cases that the gold queries would have caught otherwise.



Evaluation steps:

1. Understand the Database Schema: Identify all tables used in both queries. List all columns referenced, along with their data types and constraints. Determine primary and foreign key relationships. Note any indexes or unique constraints that may affect query execution.
2. Parse and Break Down Each Query: Identify selected columns, functions, and expressions. Note the tables involved and the join conditions. Understand the filtering conditions applied. Identify grouping and aggregate conditions, if any. Determine if result ordering affects equivalence.
3. Compare Query Components: Check if both queries use the same tables and join conditions. Compare filtering conditions in the WHERE clauses. Assess whether the same columns and expressions are selected. Identify if different functions or syntaxes achieve the same result. Look for logical equivalence in expressions and calculations.
4. Consider Edge Cases and Data Variations: Conceptualize sample datasets that include edge cases (e.g., NULL values, zero values, special characters). Analyze how each query handles these edge cases. Ensure that data type differences do not affect the outcome. Verify that constraints (e.g., NOT NULL, UNIQUE) are accounted for.
5. Evaluate Aggregations and Calculations: Confirm that aggregate functions (e.g., SUM, COUNT) are applied identically. Ensure calculations (e.g., subtraction, addition) produce the same results.
6. Check for Logical Equivalence in Conditional Expressions: Compare conditional expressions like IIF, CASE WHEN, and IF. Determine if conditions and returned values are logically the same.
7. Assess Ordering of Results: If ORDER BY clause is present, confirm that both queries order results identically. Recognize that differing order may affect equivalence if result order is significant.
8. Generate a New Logical Equivalence Rule (If Applicable): Create an "Equivalent Queries: <query1>
<query2>
Schema Conditions:<conditions>" statement that defines the equivalence. Use GENERALIZED COLUMN and TABLE NAMES. Specify any necessary conditions based on the database schema. Present the rule clearly, indicating both the equivalence and the conditions under which it holds.



Example Equivalence Rules:

<Rule>
Equivalent Queries:
SELECT c1 from t1 WHERE ...;
SELECT c1 FROM t1 WHERE ...;
Schema Conditions:
None.
</Rule>



# Guidelines:
- Make SURE complete to every step PERFECTLY without ANY Mistakes
- Follow the Rules I Gave you and Remember to AVOID generating repeated equivalence rules in the examples I gave you.
- Be sure to format your response like the example equivalence rules I gave you.
- Put <New Rule></New Rule> around the new equivalence rule that you think of. Do not use other formatting around the equivalent queries.
- Use GENERALIZED COLUMN AND TABLE NAMES in any EQUIVALENCE RULE YOU WRITE. DO NOT USE THE SAME NAMES IN THE PROVIDED QUERY PAIRS!!!!
- If the two queries are not logically equivalent, say <New Rule> Not equivalent </New Rule>.
- If the new equivalence rule is already repeated in the examples listed, say <New Rule> Rule exists </New Rule>.
- The new rule should be be MINIMAL to CLEARLY demonstrate the highlighted semantic difference. Use ellipses to shorten SQL queries where necessary to achieve this.

Take a Deep Breath and Carefully Follow the Rules, Guides and Examples I gave you. I will tip you $2000 if you do EVERYTHING Perfectly.



Pair of SQL Queries:
<Gold SQL Query>
SELECT COUNT(t1.id) FROM Player_Attributes AS t1 WHERE t1.preferred_foot = 'left' AND t1.crossing = ( SELECT MAX(crossing) FROM Player_Attributes);
</Gold SQL Query>

<Machine-generated SQL Query>
SELECT count(player_api_id) FROM player_attributes WHERE preferred_foot = 'left' AND crossing = ( SELECT max(crossing) FROM player_attributes );
</Machine-generated SQL Query>

The columns used in the queries are:\n- `id`: INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT\n- `player_api_id`: INTEGER\n- `preferred_foot`: TEXT\n- `crossing`: INTEGER\n\n### Step 2: Parse and Break Down Each Query\n\n**Gold SQL Query:**\n```sql\nSELECT COUNT(t1.id) \nFROM Player_Attributes AS t1 \nWHERE t1.preferred_foot = 'left' \nAND t1.crossing = (SELECT MAX(crossing) FROM Player_Attributes);\n```\n- Selects the count of `id` from `Player_Attributes`.\n- Filters where `preferred_foot` is 'left'.\n- Filters where `crossing` is equal to the maximum `crossing` value in the entire table.\n\n**Machine-generated SQL Query:**\n```sql\nSELECT count(player_api_id) \nFROM player_attributes \nWHERE preferred_foot = 'left' \nAND crossing = (SELECT max(crossing) FROM player_attributes);\n```\n- Selects the count of `player_api_id` from `player_attributes`.\n- Filters where `preferred_foot` is 'left'.\n- Filters where `crossing` is equal to the maximum `crossing` value in the entire table.\n\n### Step 3: Compare Query Components\n\n- Both queries use the `Player_Attributes` table.\n- Both queries filter on `preferred_foot = 'left'`.\n- Both queries filter on `crossing` being the maximum value of `crossing`.\n- The difference is in the column being counted: `id` in the gold query and `player_api_id` in the machine-generated query.\n\n### Step 4: Consider Edge Cases and Data Variations\n\n- The `id` column is a primary key, meaning it is unique and not nullable.\n- The `player_api_id` column is a foreign key and also unique in the `Player` table but not explicitly marked as unique in the `Player_Attributes` table. However, it is a foreign key, which implies uniqueness in the context of the `Player` table.\n\n### Step 5: Evaluate Aggregations and Calculations\n\n- Both queries use the `COUNT` function, but on different columns. Since `id` is a primary key, counting `id` should yield the same result as counting `player_api_id`, assuming each player attribute record has a valid `player_api_id`.\n\n### Step 6: Check for Logical Equivalence in Conditional Expressions\n\n- The conditions in the `WHERE` clause are identical in both queries.\n\n### Step 7: Assess Ordering of Results\n\n- Both queries use aggregate functions, and there is no `ORDER BY` clause, so result ordering is not applicable.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nConsidering the above analysis, the two queries are logically equivalent given the schema constraints, particularly that `player_api_id` is a foreign key and should be present for each record in `Player_Attributes`. Therefore, counting `id` and `player_api_id` should produce the same result.\n\n### Step 8: Generate a New Logical Equivalence Rule\n\nSince the equivalence is based on counting different columns where one is a primary key and the other is a unique foreign key, we can define a new rule:\n\n<New Rule>\nEquivalent Queries:\nSELECT COUNT(c1) FROM t1 WHERE ...;\nSELECT COUNT(c2) FROM t1 WHERE ...;\nSchema Conditions:\nc1 is a PRIMARY KEY and c2 is a UNIQUE FOREIGN KEY in t1.\n", role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None, refusal=None))], created=1732077887, model='gpt-4o-2024-08-06', object='chat.completion', system_fingerprint='fp_831e067d82', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=757, prompt_tokens=2991, total_tokens=3748, prompt_tokens_details={'cached_tokens': 0, 'audio_tokens': 0}, completion_tokens_details={'reasoning_tokens': 0, 'audio_tokens': 0, 'accepted_prediction_tokens': 0, 'rejected_prediction_tokens': 0}))

INFO:root:model: gpt-4o
INFO:root:prompt: You are an expert SQL engineer with 20+ years of experience. You will be given some SQL equivalence rules conditional on some database schemas. You will then be given a pair of SQL queries, consisting of a gold query and a machine-generated query, and a database schema that defines the context of the queries. 

Your task is to compare the two provided SQL queries on logical equivalence and generate one more equivalence rule in the same format as the provided example equivalence rules.

Please make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please also keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.



Evaluation Criteria:

Logical equivalence - the alignment between the gold SQL query and the machine-generated SQL query. A machine-generated SQL query is logically equivalent to the gold query if these two queries would RETURN THE SAME RESULTS AND IN THE SAME ORDER for ALL POSSIBLE DATABASE INSTANCES that satisfy the provided database schema for these queries. Annotators were asked to penalize machine-generated queries that overlooked edge cases that the gold queries would have caught otherwise.



Evaluation steps:

1. Understand the Database Schema: Identify all tables used in both queries. List all columns referenced, along with their data types and constraints. Determine primary and foreign key relationships. Note any indexes or unique constraints that may affect query execution.
2. Parse and Break Down Each Query: Identify selected columns, functions, and expressions. Note the tables involved and the join conditions. Understand the filtering conditions applied. Identify grouping and aggregate conditions, if any. Determine if result ordering affects equivalence.
3. Compare Query Components: Check if both queries use the same tables and join conditions. Compare filtering conditions in the WHERE clauses. Assess whether the same columns and expressions are selected. Identify if different functions or syntaxes achieve the same result. Look for logical equivalence in expressions and calculations.
4. Consider Edge Cases and Data Variations: Conceptualize sample datasets that include edge cases (e.g., NULL values, zero values, special characters). Analyze how each query handles these edge cases. Ensure that data type differences do not affect the outcome. Verify that constraints (e.g., NOT NULL, UNIQUE) are accounted for.
5. Evaluate Aggregations and Calculations: Confirm that aggregate functions (e.g., SUM, COUNT) are applied identically. Ensure calculations (e.g., subtraction, addition) produce the same results.
6. Check for Logical Equivalence in Conditional Expressions: Compare conditional expressions like IIF, CASE WHEN, and IF. Determine if conditions and returned values are logically the same.
7. Assess Ordering of Results: If ORDER BY clause is present, confirm that both queries order results identically. Recognize that differing order may affect equivalence if result order is significant.
8. Generate a New Logical Equivalence Rule (If Applicable): Create an "Equivalent Queries: <query1>
<query2>
Schema Conditions:<conditions>" statement that defines the equivalence. Use GENERALIZED COLUMN and TABLE NAMES. Specify any necessary conditions based on the database schema. Present the rule clearly, indicating both the equivalence and the conditions under which it holds.



Example Equivalence Rules:

<Rule>
Equivalent Queries:
SELECT c1 from t1 WHERE ...;
SELECT c1 FROM t1 WHERE ...;
Schema Conditions:
None.
</Rule>



# Guidelines:
- Make SURE complete to every step PERFECTLY without ANY Mistakes
- Follow the Rules I Gave you and Remember to AVOID generating repeated equivalence rules in the examples I gave you.
- Be sure to format your response like the example equivalence rules I gave you.
- Put <New Rule></New Rule> around the new equivalence rule that you think of. Do not use other formatting around the equivalent queries.
- Use GENERALIZED COLUMN AND TABLE NAMES in any EQUIVALENCE RULE YOU WRITE. DO NOT USE THE SAME NAMES IN THE PROVIDED QUERY PAIRS!!!!
- If the two queries are not logically equivalent, say <New Rule> Not equivalent </New Rule>.
- If the new equivalence rule is already repeated in the examples listed, say <New Rule> Rule exists </New Rule>.
- The new rule should be be MINIMAL to CLEARLY demonstrate the highlighted semantic difference. Use ellipses to shorten SQL queries where necessary to achieve this.

Take a Deep Breath and Carefully Follow the Rules, Guides and Examples I gave you. I will tip you $2000 if you do EVERYTHING Perfectly.

INFO:root:model: gpt-4o
INFO:root:prompt: You are an expert SQL engineer with 20+ years of experience. You will be given some SQL equivalence rules conditional on some database schemas. You will then be given a pair of SQL queries, consisting of a gold query and a machine-generated query, and a database schema that defines the context of the queries. 

Your task is to compare the two provided SQL queries on logical equivalence and generate one more equivalence rule in the same format as the provided example equivalence rules.

Please make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please also keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.



Evaluation Criteria:

Logical equivalence - the alignment between the gold SQL query and the machine-generated SQL query. A machine-generated SQL query is logically equivalent to the gold query if these two queries would RETURN THE SAME RESULTS AND IN THE SAME ORDER for ALL POSSIBLE DATABASE INSTANCES that satisfy the provided database schema for these queries. Annotators were asked to penalize machine-generated queries that overlooked edge cases that the gold queries would have caught otherwise.



Evaluation steps:

1. Understand the Database Schema: Identify all tables used in both queries. List all columns referenced, along with their data types and constraints. Determine primary and foreign key relationships. Note any indexes or unique constraints that may affect query execution.
2. Parse and Break Down Each Query: Identify selected columns, functions, and expressions. Note the tables involved and the join conditions. Understand the filtering conditions applied. Identify grouping and aggregate conditions, if any. Determine if result ordering affects equivalence.
3. Compare Query Components: Check if both queries use the same tables and join conditions. Compare filtering conditions in the WHERE clauses. Assess whether the same columns and expressions are selected. Identify if different functions or syntaxes achieve the same result. Look for logical equivalence in expressions and calculations.
4. Consider Edge Cases and Data Variations: Conceptualize sample datasets that include edge cases (e.g., NULL values, zero values, special characters). Analyze how each query handles these edge cases. Ensure that data type differences do not affect the outcome. Verify that constraints (e.g., NOT NULL, UNIQUE) are accounted for.
5. Evaluate Aggregations and Calculations: Confirm that aggregate functions (e.g., SUM, COUNT) are applied identically. Ensure calculations (e.g., subtraction, addition) produce the same results.
6. Check for Logical Equivalence in Conditional Expressions: Compare conditional expressions like IIF, CASE WHEN, and IF. Determine if conditions and returned values are logically the same.
7. Assess Ordering of Results: If ORDER BY clause is present, confirm that both queries order results identically. Recognize that differing order may affect equivalence if result order is significant.
8. Generate a New Logical Equivalence Rule (If Applicable): Create an "Equivalent Queries: <query1>
<query2>
Schema Conditions:<conditions>" statement that defines the equivalence. Use GENERALIZED COLUMN and TABLE NAMES. Specify any necessary conditions based on the database schema. Present the rule clearly, indicating both the equivalence and the conditions under which it holds.



Example Equivalence Rules:

<Rule>
Equivalent Queries:
SELECT c1 from t1 WHERE ...;
SELECT c1 FROM t1 WHERE ...;
Schema Conditions:
None.
</Rule>



# Guidelines:
- Make SURE complete to every step PERFECTLY without ANY Mistakes
- Follow the Rules I Gave you and Remember to AVOID generating repeated equivalence rules in the examples I gave you.
- Be sure to format your response like the example equivalence rules I gave you.
- Put <New Rule></New Rule> around the new equivalence rule that you think of. Do not use other formatting around the equivalent queries.
- Use GENERALIZED COLUMN AND TABLE NAMES in any EQUIVALENCE RULE YOU WRITE. DO NOT USE THE SAME NAMES IN THE PROVIDED QUERY PAIRS!!!!
- If the two queries are not logically equivalent, say <New Rule> Not equivalent </New Rule>.
- If the new equivalence rule is already repeated in the examples listed, say <New Rule> Rule exists </New Rule>.
- The new rule should be be MINIMAL to CLEARLY demonstrate the highlighted semantic difference. Use ellipses to shorten SQL queries where necessary to achieve this.

Take a Deep Breath and Carefully Follow the Rules, Guides and Examples I gave you. I will tip you $2000 if you do EVERYTHING Perfectly.

Understand the Database Schema\n\n**Tables Involved:**\n- `Team_Attributes`\n- `Team`\n\n**Columns Referenced:**\n- `Team_Attributes.buildUpPlaySpeedClass`\n- `Team.team_api_id`\n- `Team.team_long_name`\n\n**Primary and Foreign Key Relationships:**\n- `Team_Attributes.team_api_id` is a foreign key referencing `Team.team_api_id`.\n- `Team.team_api_id` is a unique identifier for the `Team` table.\n\n### 2. Parse and Break Down Each Query\n\n**Gold SQL Query:**\n```sql\nSELECT DISTINCT t1.buildUpPlaySpeedClass \nFROM Team_Attributes AS t1 \nINNER JOIN Team AS t2 ON t1.team_api_id = t2.team_api_id \nWHERE t2.team_long_name = 'KSV Cercle Brugge';\n```\n- **Selected Column:** `t1.buildUpPlaySpeedClass`\n- **Join Condition:** `t1.team_api_id = t2.team_api_id`\n- **Filter Condition:** `t2.team_long_name = 'KSV Cercle Brugge'`\n- **Distinct Values:** Yes\n\n**Machine-generated SQL Query:**\n```sql\nSELECT DISTINCT team_attributes.buildupplayspeedclass \nFROM team \nINNER JOIN team_attributes ON team.team_api_id = team_attributes.team_api_id \nWHERE team.team_long_name = 'KSV Cercle Brugge';\n```\n- **Selected Column:** `team_attributes.buildupplayspeedclass`\n- **Join Condition:** `team.team_api_id = team_attributes.team_api_id`\n- **Filter Condition:** `team.team_long_name = 'KSV Cercle Brugge'`\n- **Distinct Values:** Yes\n\n### 3. Compare Query Components\n\nBoth queries use the same tables and join conditions. They apply the same filtering condition in the WHERE clause and select the same column, albeit with different aliasing. The use of `DISTINCT` is consistent in both queries.\n\n### 4. Consider Edge Cases and Data Variations\n\n- **NULL values:** Not applicable as `team_long_name` is likely not nullable.\n- **Data type differences:** Both queries refer to the same data types as they use the same columns.\n- **Constraints:** The foreign key constraint ensures valid joins.\n\n### 5. Evaluate Aggregations and Calculations\n\nNo aggregate functions or calculations are involved.\n\n### 6. Check for Logical Equivalence in Conditional Expressions\n\nNo complex conditional expressions are present.\n\n### 7. Assess Ordering of Results\n\nBoth queries use `DISTINCT`, which implies that result ordering is not significant for equivalence.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe machine-generated query is logically equivalent to the gold query. The differences in table aliasing do not affect the logical equivalence. Therefore, we can generate a new equivalence rule.\n\n<New Rule>\nEquivalent Queries:\nSELECT DISTINCT t1.c1 FROM t2 INNER JOIN t1 ON t2.c2 = t1.c2 WHERE t2.c3 = 'value';\nSELECT DISTINCT t1.c1 FROM t2 INNER JOIN t1 ON t1.c2 = t2.c2 WHERE t2.c3 = 'value';\nSchema Conditions:\nNone.\n", role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None, refusal=None))], created=1732077949, model='gpt-4o-2024-08-06', object='chat.completion', system_fingerprint='fp_831e067d82', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=667, prompt_tokens=3008, total_tokens=3675, prompt_tokens_details={'cached_tokens': 2816, 'audio_tokens': 0}, completion_tokens_details={'reasoning_tokens': 0, 'audio_tokens': 0, 'accepted_prediction_tokens': 0, 'rejected_prediction_tokens': 0}))

INFO:root:model: gpt-4o
INFO:root:prompt: You are an expert SQL engineer with 20+ years of experience. You will be given some SQL equivalence rules conditional on some database schemas. You will then be given a pair of SQL queries, consisting of a gold query and a machine-generated query, and a database schema that defines the context of the queries. 

Your task is to compare the two provided SQL queries on logical equivalence and generate one more equivalence rule in the same format as the provided example equivalence rules.

Please make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please also keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.



Evaluation Criteria:

Logical equivalence - the alignment between the gold SQL query and the machine-generated SQL query. A machine-generated SQL query is logically equivalent to the gold query if these two queries would RETURN THE SAME RESULTS AND IN THE SAME ORDER for ALL POSSIBLE DATABASE INSTANCES that satisfy the provided database schema for these queries. Annotators were asked to penalize machine-generated queries that overlooked edge cases that the gold queries would have caught otherwise.



Evaluation steps:

1. Understand the Database Schema: Identify all tables used in both queries. List all columns referenced, along with their data types and constraints. Determine primary and foreign key relationships. Note any indexes or unique constraints that may affect query execution.
2. Parse and Break Down Each Query: Identify selected columns, functions, and expressions. Note the tables involved and the join conditions. Understand the filtering conditions applied. Identify grouping and aggregate conditions, if any. Determine if result ordering affects equivalence.
3. Compare Query Components: Check if both queries use the same tables and join conditions. Compare filtering conditions in the WHERE clauses. Assess whether the same columns and expressions are selected. Identify if different functions or syntaxes achieve the same result. Look for logical equivalence in expressions and calculations.
4. Consider Edge Cases and Data Variations: Conceptualize sample datasets that include edge cases (e.g., NULL values, zero values, special characters). Analyze how each query handles these edge cases. Ensure that data type differences do not affect the outcome. Verify that constraints (e.g., NOT NULL, UNIQUE) are accounted for.
5. Evaluate Aggregations and Calculations: Confirm that aggregate functions (e.g., SUM, COUNT) are applied identically. Ensure calculations (e.g., subtraction, addition) produce the same results.
6. Check for Logical Equivalence in Conditional Expressions: Compare conditional expressions like IIF, CASE WHEN, and IF. Determine if conditions and returned values are logically the same.
7. Assess Ordering of Results: If ORDER BY clause is present, confirm that both queries order results identically. Recognize that differing order may affect equivalence if result order is significant.
8. Generate a New Logical Equivalence Rule (If Applicable): Create an "Equivalent Queries: <query1>
<query2>
Schema Conditions:<conditions>" statement that defines the equivalence. Use GENERALIZED COLUMN and TABLE NAMES. Specify any necessary conditions based on the database schema. Present the rule clearly, indicating both the equivalence and the conditions under which it holds.



Example Equivalence Rules:

<Rule>
Equivalent Queries:
SELECT c1 from t1 WHERE ...;
SELECT c1 FROM t1 WHERE ...;
Schema Conditions:
None.
</Rule>



# Guidelines:
- Make SURE complete to every step PERFECTLY without ANY Mistakes
- Follow the Rules I Gave you and Remember to AVOID generating repeated equivalence rules in the examples I gave you.
- Be sure to format your response like the example equivalence rules I gave you.
- Put <New Rule></New Rule> around the new equivalence rule that you think of. Do not use other formatting around the equivalent queries.
- Use GENERALIZED COLUMN AND TABLE NAMES in any EQUIVALENCE RULE YOU WRITE. DO NOT USE THE SAME NAMES IN THE PROVIDED QUERY PAIRS!!!!
- If the two queries are not logically equivalent, say <New Rule> Not equivalent </New Rule>.
- If the new equivalence rule is already repeated in the examples listed, say <New Rule> Rule exists </New Rule>.
- The new rule should be be MINIMAL to CLEARLY demonstrate the highlighted semantic difference. Use ellipses to shorten SQL queries where necessary to achieve this.

Take a Deep Breath and Carefully Follow the Rules, Guides and Examples I gave you. I will tip you $2000 if you do EVERYTHING Perfectly.



Pair of SQL Queries:
<Gold SQL Query>
SELECT t1.name FROM League AS t1 INNER JOIN Match AS t2 ON t1.id = t2.league_id WHERE t2.season = '2015/2016' GROUP BY t1.name ORDER BY COUNT(t2.id) DESC LIMIT 4;
</Gold SQL Query>

<Machine-generated SQL Query>
SELECT league.name FROM league INNER JOIN MATCH ON league.id = MATCH.league_id WHERE MATCH.season = '2015/2016' GROUP BY league.name ORDER BY count(MATCH.id) DESC LIMIT 4;

INFO:root:model: gpt-4o
INFO:root:prompt: You are an expert SQL engineer with 20+ years of experience. You will be given some SQL equivalence rules conditional on some database schemas. You will then be given a pair of SQL queries, consisting of a gold query and a machine-generated query, and a database schema that defines the context of the queries. 

Your task is to compare the two provided SQL queries on logical equivalence and generate one more equivalence rule in the same format as the provided example equivalence rules.

Please make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please also keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.



Evaluation Criteria:

Logical equivalence - the alignment between the gold SQL query and the machine-generated SQL query. A machine-generated SQL query is logically equivalent to the gold query if these two queries would RETURN THE SAME RESULTS AND IN THE SAME ORDER for ALL POSSIBLE DATABASE INSTANCES that satisfy the provided database schema for these queries. Annotators were asked to penalize machine-generated queries that overlooked edge cases that the gold queries would have caught otherwise.



Evaluation steps:

1. Understand the Database Schema: Identify all tables used in both queries. List all columns referenced, along with their data types and constraints. Determine primary and foreign key relationships. Note any indexes or unique constraints that may affect query execution.
2. Parse and Break Down Each Query: Identify selected columns, functions, and expressions. Note the tables involved and the join conditions. Understand the filtering conditions applied. Identify grouping and aggregate conditions, if any. Determine if result ordering affects equivalence.
3. Compare Query Components: Check if both queries use the same tables and join conditions. Compare filtering conditions in the WHERE clauses. Assess whether the same columns and expressions are selected. Identify if different functions or syntaxes achieve the same result. Look for logical equivalence in expressions and calculations.
4. Consider Edge Cases and Data Variations: Conceptualize sample datasets that include edge cases (e.g., NULL values, zero values, special characters). Analyze how each query handles these edge cases. Ensure that data type differences do not affect the outcome. Verify that constraints (e.g., NOT NULL, UNIQUE) are accounted for.
5. Evaluate Aggregations and Calculations: Confirm that aggregate functions (e.g., SUM, COUNT) are applied identically. Ensure calculations (e.g., subtraction, addition) produce the same results.
6. Check for Logical Equivalence in Conditional Expressions: Compare conditional expressions like IIF, CASE WHEN, and IF. Determine if conditions and returned values are logically the same.
7. Assess Ordering of Results: If ORDER BY clause is present, confirm that both queries order results identically. Recognize that differing order may affect equivalence if result order is significant.
8. Generate a New Logical Equivalence Rule (If Applicable): Create an "Equivalent Queries: <query1>
<query2>
Schema Conditions:<conditions>" statement that defines the equivalence. Use GENERALIZED COLUMN and TABLE NAMES. Specify any necessary conditions based on the database schema. Present the rule clearly, indicating both the equivalence and the conditions under which it holds.



Example Equivalence Rules:

<Rule>
Equivalent Queries:
SELECT c1 from t1 WHERE ...;
SELECT c1 FROM t1 WHERE ...;
Schema Conditions:
None.
</Rule>



# Guidelines:
- Make SURE complete to every step PERFECTLY without ANY Mistakes
- Follow the Rules I Gave you and Remember to AVOID generating repeated equivalence rules in the examples I gave you.
- Be sure to format your response like the example equivalence rules I gave you.
- Put <New Rule></New Rule> around the new equivalence rule that you think of. Do not use other formatting around the equivalent queries.
- Use GENERALIZED COLUMN AND TABLE NAMES in any EQUIVALENCE RULE YOU WRITE. DO NOT USE THE SAME NAMES IN THE PROVIDED QUERY PAIRS!!!!
- If the two queries are not logically equivalent, say <New Rule> Not equivalent </New Rule>.
- If the new equivalence rule is already repeated in the examples listed, say <New Rule> Rule exists </New Rule>.
- The new rule should be be MINIMAL to CLEARLY demonstrate the highlighted semantic difference. Use ellipses to shorten SQL queries where necessary to achieve this.

Take a Deep Breath and Carefully Follow the Rules, Guides and Examples I gave you. I will tip you $2000 if you do EVERYTHING Perfectly.



Pair of SQL Queries:
<Gold SQL Query>
SELECT t2.team_long_name FROM Match AS t1 INNER JOIN Team AS t2 ON t1.away_team_api_id = t2.team_api_id ORDER BY t1.away_team_goal DESC LIMIT 1;
</Gold SQL Query>

<Machine-generated SQL Query>
SELECT team.team_long_name FROM team INNER JOIN MATCH ON team.team_api_id = MATCH.away_team_api_id ORDER BY MATCH.away_team_goal DESC LIMIT 1;
</Machine-generated SQL Query>

INFO:root:model: gpt-4o
INFO:root:prompt: You are an expert SQL engineer with 20+ years of experience. You will be given some SQL equivalence rules conditional on some database schemas. You will then be given a pair of SQL queries, consisting of a gold query and a machine-generated query, and a database schema that defines the context of the queries. 

Your task is to compare the two provided SQL queries on logical equivalence and generate one more equivalence rule in the same format as the provided example equivalence rules.

Please make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please also keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.



Evaluation Criteria:

Logical equivalence - the alignment between the gold SQL query and the machine-generated SQL query. A machine-generated SQL query is logically equivalent to the gold query if these two queries would RETURN THE SAME RESULTS AND IN THE SAME ORDER for ALL POSSIBLE DATABASE INSTANCES that satisfy the provided database schema for these queries. Annotators were asked to penalize machine-generated queries that overlooked edge cases that the gold queries would have caught otherwise.



Evaluation steps:

1. Understand the Database Schema: Identify all tables used in both queries. List all columns referenced, along with their data types and constraints. Determine primary and foreign key relationships. Note any indexes or unique constraints that may affect query execution.
2. Parse and Break Down Each Query: Identify selected columns, functions, and expressions. Note the tables involved and the join conditions. Understand the filtering conditions applied. Identify grouping and aggregate conditions, if any. Determine if result ordering affects equivalence.
3. Compare Query Components: Check if both queries use the same tables and join conditions. Compare filtering conditions in the WHERE clauses. Assess whether the same columns and expressions are selected. Identify if different functions or syntaxes achieve the same result. Look for logical equivalence in expressions and calculations.
4. Consider Edge Cases and Data Variations: Conceptualize sample datasets that include edge cases (e.g., NULL values, zero values, special characters). Analyze how each query handles these edge cases. Ensure that data type differences do not affect the outcome. Verify that constraints (e.g., NOT NULL, UNIQUE) are accounted for.
5. Evaluate Aggregations and Calculations: Confirm that aggregate functions (e.g., SUM, COUNT) are applied identically. Ensure calculations (e.g., subtraction, addition) produce the same results.
6. Check for Logical Equivalence in Conditional Expressions: Compare conditional expressions like IIF, CASE WHEN, and IF. Determine if conditions and returned values are logically the same.
7. Assess Ordering of Results: If ORDER BY clause is present, confirm that both queries order results identically. Recognize that differing order may affect equivalence if result order is significant.
8. Generate a New Logical Equivalence Rule (If Applicable): Create an "Equivalent Queries: <query1>
<query2>
Schema Conditions:<conditions>" statement that defines the equivalence. Use GENERALIZED COLUMN and TABLE NAMES. Specify any necessary conditions based on the database schema. Present the rule clearly, indicating both the equivalence and the conditions under which it holds.



Example Equivalence Rules:

<Rule>
Equivalent Queries:
SELECT c1 from t1 WHERE ...;
SELECT c1 FROM t1 WHERE ...;
Schema Conditions:
None.
</Rule>



# Guidelines:
- Make SURE complete to every step PERFECTLY without ANY Mistakes
- Follow the Rules I Gave you and Remember to AVOID generating repeated equivalence rules in the examples I gave you.
- Be sure to format your response like the example equivalence rules I gave you.
- Put <New Rule></New Rule> around the new equivalence rule that you think of. Do not use other formatting around the equivalent queries.
- Use GENERALIZED COLUMN AND TABLE NAMES in any EQUIVALENCE RULE YOU WRITE. DO NOT USE THE SAME NAMES IN THE PROVIDED QUERY PAIRS!!!!
- If the two queries are not logically equivalent, say <New Rule> Not equivalent </New Rule>.
- If the new equivalence rule is already repeated in the examples listed, say <New Rule> Rule exists </New Rule>.
- The new rule should be be MINIMAL to CLEARLY demonstrate the highlighted semantic difference. Use ellipses to shorten SQL queries where necessary to achieve this.

Take a Deep Breath and Carefully Follow the Rules, Guides and Examples I gave you. I will tip you $2000 if you do EVERYTHING Perfectly.

THEN t1.id ELSE NULL END)` whereas the Machine-generated Query uses `SUM(CASE WHEN ... THEN 1 ELSE 0 END)`. Both expressions effectively count the number of rows meeting the condition.\n- The denominator in both queries is the total count of rows from the `Player` table, which is logically equivalent.\n\n### Step 4: Consider Edge Cases and Data Variations\n\n- Both queries handle NULL values equivalently, as the conditions are identical.\n- The data type differences do not affect the outcome, as both queries cast the result to REAL.\n\n### Step 5: Evaluate Aggregations and Calculations\n\n- The aggregate functions (`COUNT` and `SUM`) are applied in a logically equivalent manner to achieve the same result.\n\n### Step 6: Check for Logical Equivalence in Conditional Expressions\n\n- The conditional expressions are logically equivalent, both counting the number of players with `height < 180` and `overall_rating > 70`.\n\n### Step 7: Assess Ordering of Results\n\n- No `ORDER BY` clause is present in either query, so result ordering does not affect equivalence.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBoth queries are logically equivalent. Here is the new equivalence rule:\n\n<New Rule>\nEquivalent Queries:\nSELECT CAST(COUNT(CASE WHEN t2.c2 > ... AND t1.c1 < ...

INFO:root:model: gpt-4o
INFO:root:prompt: You are an expert SQL engineer with 20+ years of experience. You will be given some SQL equivalence rules conditional on some database schemas. You will then be given a pair of SQL queries, consisting of a gold query and a machine-generated query, and a database schema that defines the context of the queries. 

Your task is to compare the two provided SQL queries on logical equivalence and generate one more equivalence rule in the same format as the provided example equivalence rules.

Please make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please also keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.



Evaluation Criteria:

Logical equivalence - the alignment between the gold SQL query and the machine-generated SQL query. A machine-generated SQL query is logically equivalent to the gold query if these two queries would RETURN THE SAME RESULTS AND IN THE SAME ORDER for ALL POSSIBLE DATABASE INSTANCES that satisfy the provided database schema for these queries. Annotators were asked to penalize machine-generated queries that overlooked edge cases that the gold queries would have caught otherwise.



Evaluation steps:

1. Understand the Database Schema: Identify all tables used in both queries. List all columns referenced, along with their data types and constraints. Determine primary and foreign key relationships. Note any indexes or unique constraints that may affect query execution.
2. Parse and Break Down Each Query: Identify selected columns, functions, and expressions. Note the tables involved and the join conditions. Understand the filtering conditions applied. Identify grouping and aggregate conditions, if any. Determine if result ordering affects equivalence.
3. Compare Query Components: Check if both queries use the same tables and join conditions. Compare filtering conditions in the WHERE clauses. Assess whether the same columns and expressions are selected. Identify if different functions or syntaxes achieve the same result. Look for logical equivalence in expressions and calculations.
4. Consider Edge Cases and Data Variations: Conceptualize sample datasets that include edge cases (e.g., NULL values, zero values, special characters). Analyze how each query handles these edge cases. Ensure that data type differences do not affect the outcome. Verify that constraints (e.g., NOT NULL, UNIQUE) are accounted for.
5. Evaluate Aggregations and Calculations: Confirm that aggregate functions (e.g., SUM, COUNT) are applied identically. Ensure calculations (e.g., subtraction, addition) produce the same results.
6. Check for Logical Equivalence in Conditional Expressions: Compare conditional expressions like IIF, CASE WHEN, and IF. Determine if conditions and returned values are logically the same.
7. Assess Ordering of Results: If ORDER BY clause is present, confirm that both queries order results identically. Recognize that differing order may affect equivalence if result order is significant.
8. Generate a New Logical Equivalence Rule (If Applicable): Create an "Equivalent Queries: <query1>
<query2>
Schema Conditions:<conditions>" statement that defines the equivalence. Use GENERALIZED COLUMN and TABLE NAMES. Specify any necessary conditions based on the database schema. Present the rule clearly, indicating both the equivalence and the conditions under which it holds.



Example Equivalence Rules:

<Rule>
Equivalent Queries:
SELECT c1 from t1 WHERE ...;
SELECT c1 FROM t1 WHERE ...;
Schema Conditions:
None.
</Rule>



# Guidelines:
- Make SURE complete to every step PERFECTLY without ANY Mistakes
- Follow the Rules I Gave you and Remember to AVOID generating repeated equivalence rules in the examples I gave you.
- Be sure to format your response like the example equivalence rules I gave you.
- Put <New Rule></New Rule> around the new equivalence rule that you think of. Do not use other formatting around the equivalent queries.
- Use GENERALIZED COLUMN AND TABLE NAMES in any EQUIVALENCE RULE YOU WRITE. DO NOT USE THE SAME NAMES IN THE PROVIDED QUERY PAIRS!!!!
- If the two queries are not logically equivalent, say <New Rule> Not equivalent </New Rule>.
- If the new equivalence rule is already repeated in the examples listed, say <New Rule> Rule exists </New Rule>.
- The new rule should be be MINIMAL to CLEARLY demonstrate the highlighted semantic difference. Use ellipses to shorten SQL queries where necessary to achieve this.

Take a Deep Breath and Carefully Follow the Rules, Guides and Examples I gave you. I will tip you $2000 if you do EVERYTHING Perfectly.

INFO:root:model: gpt-4o
INFO:root:prompt: You are an expert SQL engineer with 20+ years of experience. You will be given some SQL equivalence rules conditional on some database schemas. You will then be given a pair of SQL queries, consisting of a gold query and a machine-generated query, and a database schema that defines the context of the queries. 

Your task is to compare the two provided SQL queries on logical equivalence and generate one more equivalence rule in the same format as the provided example equivalence rules.

Please make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please also keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.



Evaluation Criteria:

Logical equivalence - the alignment between the gold SQL query and the machine-generated SQL query. A machine-generated SQL query is logically equivalent to the gold query if these two queries would RETURN THE SAME RESULTS AND IN THE SAME ORDER for ALL POSSIBLE DATABASE INSTANCES that satisfy the provided database schema for these queries. Annotators were asked to penalize machine-generated queries that overlooked edge cases that the gold queries would have caught otherwise.



Evaluation steps:

1. Understand the Database Schema: Identify all tables used in both queries. List all columns referenced, along with their data types and constraints. Determine primary and foreign key relationships. Note any indexes or unique constraints that may affect query execution.
2. Parse and Break Down Each Query: Identify selected columns, functions, and expressions. Note the tables involved and the join conditions. Understand the filtering conditions applied. Identify grouping and aggregate conditions, if any. Determine if result ordering affects equivalence.
3. Compare Query Components: Check if both queries use the same tables and join conditions. Compare filtering conditions in the WHERE clauses. Assess whether the same columns and expressions are selected. Identify if different functions or syntaxes achieve the same result. Look for logical equivalence in expressions and calculations.
4. Consider Edge Cases and Data Variations: Conceptualize sample datasets that include edge cases (e.g., NULL values, zero values, special characters). Analyze how each query handles these edge cases. Ensure that data type differences do not affect the outcome. Verify that constraints (e.g., NOT NULL, UNIQUE) are accounted for.
5. Evaluate Aggregations and Calculations: Confirm that aggregate functions (e.g., SUM, COUNT) are applied identically. Ensure calculations (e.g., subtraction, addition) produce the same results.
6. Check for Logical Equivalence in Conditional Expressions: Compare conditional expressions like IIF, CASE WHEN, and IF. Determine if conditions and returned values are logically the same.
7. Assess Ordering of Results: If ORDER BY clause is present, confirm that both queries order results identically. Recognize that differing order may affect equivalence if result order is significant.
8. Generate a New Logical Equivalence Rule (If Applicable): Create an "Equivalent Queries: <query1>
<query2>
Schema Conditions:<conditions>" statement that defines the equivalence. Use GENERALIZED COLUMN and TABLE NAMES. Specify any necessary conditions based on the database schema. Present the rule clearly, indicating both the equivalence and the conditions under which it holds.



Example Equivalence Rules:

<Rule>
Equivalent Queries:
SELECT c1 from t1 WHERE ...;
SELECT c1 FROM t1 WHERE ...;
Schema Conditions:
None.
</Rule>



# Guidelines:
- Make SURE complete to every step PERFECTLY without ANY Mistakes
- Follow the Rules I Gave you and Remember to AVOID generating repeated equivalence rules in the examples I gave you.
- Be sure to format your response like the example equivalence rules I gave you.
- Put <New Rule></New Rule> around the new equivalence rule that you think of. Do not use other formatting around the equivalent queries.
- Use GENERALIZED COLUMN AND TABLE NAMES in any EQUIVALENCE RULE YOU WRITE. DO NOT USE THE SAME NAMES IN THE PROVIDED QUERY PAIRS!!!!
- If the two queries are not logically equivalent, say <New Rule> Not equivalent </New Rule>.
- If the new equivalence rule is already repeated in the examples listed, say <New Rule> Rule exists </New Rule>.
- The new rule should be be MINIMAL to CLEARLY demonstrate the highlighted semantic difference. Use ellipses to shorten SQL queries where necessary to achieve this.

Take a Deep Breath and Carefully Follow the Rules, Guides and Examples I gave you. I will tip you $2000 if you do EVERYTHING Perfectly.



Pair of SQL Queries:
<Gold SQL Query>
SELECT T1.nationality FROM drivers AS T1 INNER JOIN results AS T2 ON T2.driverId = T1.driverId ORDER BY T2.fastestLapSpeed DESC LIMIT 1;

<Machine-generated SQL Query>

INFO:root:model: gpt-4o
INFO:root:prompt: You are an expert SQL engineer with 20+ years of experience. You will be given some SQL equivalence rules conditional on some database schemas. You will then be given a pair of SQL queries, consisting of a gold query and a machine-generated query, and a database schema that defines the context of the queries. 

Your task is to compare the two provided SQL queries on logical equivalence and generate one more equivalence rule in the same format as the provided example equivalence rules.

Please make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please also keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.



Evaluation Criteria:

Logical equivalence - the alignment between the gold SQL query and the machine-generated SQL query. A machine-generated SQL query is logically equivalent to the gold query if these two queries would RETURN THE SAME RESULTS AND IN THE SAME ORDER for ALL POSSIBLE DATABASE INSTANCES that satisfy the provided database schema for these queries. Annotators were asked to penalize machine-generated queries that overlooked edge cases that the gold queries would have caught otherwise.



Evaluation steps:

1. Understand the Database Schema: Identify all tables used in both queries. List all columns referenced, along with their data types and constraints. Determine primary and foreign key relationships. Note any indexes or unique constraints that may affect query execution.
2. Parse and Break Down Each Query: Identify selected columns, functions, and expressions. Note the tables involved and the join conditions. Understand the filtering conditions applied. Identify grouping and aggregate conditions, if any. Determine if result ordering affects equivalence.
3. Compare Query Components: Check if both queries use the same tables and join conditions. Compare filtering conditions in the WHERE clauses. Assess whether the same columns and expressions are selected. Identify if different functions or syntaxes achieve the same result. Look for logical equivalence in expressions and calculations.
4. Consider Edge Cases and Data Variations: Conceptualize sample datasets that include edge cases (e.g., NULL values, zero values, special characters). Analyze how each query handles these edge cases. Ensure that data type differences do not affect the outcome. Verify that constraints (e.g., NOT NULL, UNIQUE) are accounted for.
5. Evaluate Aggregations and Calculations: Confirm that aggregate functions (e.g., SUM, COUNT) are applied identically. Ensure calculations (e.g., subtraction, addition) produce the same results.
6. Check for Logical Equivalence in Conditional Expressions: Compare conditional expressions like IIF, CASE WHEN, and IF. Determine if conditions and returned values are logically the same.
7. Assess Ordering of Results: If ORDER BY clause is present, confirm that both queries order results identically. Recognize that differing order may affect equivalence if result order is significant.
8. Generate a New Logical Equivalence Rule (If Applicable): Create an "Equivalent Queries: <query1>
<query2>
Schema Conditions:<conditions>" statement that defines the equivalence. Use GENERALIZED COLUMN and TABLE NAMES. Specify any necessary conditions based on the database schema. Present the rule clearly, indicating both the equivalence and the conditions under which it holds.



Example Equivalence Rules:

<Rule>
Equivalent Queries:
SELECT c1 from t1 WHERE ...;
SELECT c1 FROM t1 WHERE ...;
Schema Conditions:
None.
</Rule>



# Guidelines:
- Make SURE complete to every step PERFECTLY without ANY Mistakes
- Follow the Rules I Gave you and Remember to AVOID generating repeated equivalence rules in the examples I gave you.
- Be sure to format your response like the example equivalence rules I gave you.
- Put <New Rule></New Rule> around the new equivalence rule that you think of. Do not use other formatting around the equivalent queries.
- Use GENERALIZED COLUMN AND TABLE NAMES in any EQUIVALENCE RULE YOU WRITE. DO NOT USE THE SAME NAMES IN THE PROVIDED QUERY PAIRS!!!!
- If the two queries are not logically equivalent, say <New Rule> Not equivalent </New Rule>.
- If the new equivalence rule is already repeated in the examples listed, say <New Rule> Rule exists </New Rule>.
- The new rule should be be MINIMAL to CLEARLY demonstrate the highlighted semantic difference. Use ellipses to shorten SQL queries where necessary to achieve this.

Take a Deep Breath and Carefully Follow the Rules, Guides and Examples I gave you. I will tip you $2000 if you do EVERYTHING Perfectly.

<Gold SQL Query>
SELECT T1.nationality FROM drivers AS T1 INNER JOIN results AS T2 ON T2.driverId = T1.driverId ORDER BY T2.fastestLapSpeed DESC LIMIT 1;

<Machine-generated SQL Query>
SELECT nationality FROM drivers WHERE driverid = ( SELECT driverid FROM results ORDER BY fastestlapspeed DESC LIMIT 1 );

INFO:root:model: gpt-4o
INFO:root:prompt: You are an expert SQL engineer with 20+ years of experience. You will be given some SQL equivalence rules conditional on some database schemas. You will then be given a pair of SQL queries, consisting of a gold query and a machine-generated query, and a database schema that defines the context of the queries. 

Your task is to compare the two provided SQL queries on logical equivalence and generate one more equivalence rule in the same format as the provided example equivalence rules.

Please make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please also keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.



Evaluation Criteria:

Logical equivalence - the alignment between the gold SQL query and the machine-generated SQL query. A machine-generated SQL query is logically equivalent to the gold query if these two queries would RETURN THE SAME RESULTS AND IN THE SAME ORDER for ALL POSSIBLE DATABASE INSTANCES that satisfy the provided database schema for these queries. Annotators were asked to penalize machine-generated queries that overlooked edge cases that the gold queries would have caught otherwise.



Evaluation steps:

1. Understand the Database Schema: Identify all tables used in both queries. List all columns referenced, along with their data types and constraints. Determine primary and foreign key relationships. Note any indexes or unique constraints that may affect query execution.
2. Parse and Break Down Each Query: Identify selected columns, functions, and expressions. Note the tables involved and the join conditions. Understand the filtering conditions applied. Identify grouping and aggregate conditions, if any. Determine if result ordering affects equivalence.
3. Compare Query Components: Check if both queries use the same tables and join conditions. Compare filtering conditions in the WHERE clauses. Assess whether the same columns and expressions are selected. Identify if different functions or syntaxes achieve the same result. Look for logical equivalence in expressions and calculations.
4. Consider Edge Cases and Data Variations: Conceptualize sample datasets that include edge cases (e.g., NULL values, zero values, special characters). Analyze how each query handles these edge cases. Ensure that data type differences do not affect the outcome. Verify that constraints (e.g., NOT NULL, UNIQUE) are accounted for.
5. Evaluate Aggregations and Calculations: Confirm that aggregate functions (e.g., SUM, COUNT) are applied identically. Ensure calculations (e.g., subtraction, addition) produce the same results.
6. Check for Logical Equivalence in Conditional Expressions: Compare conditional expressions like IIF, CASE WHEN, and IF. Determine if conditions and returned values are logically the same.
7. Assess Ordering of Results: If ORDER BY clause is present, confirm that both queries order results identically. Recognize that differing order may affect equivalence if result order is significant.
8. Generate a New Logical Equivalence Rule (If Applicable): Create an "Equivalent Queries: <query1>
<query2>
Schema Conditions:<conditions>" statement that defines the equivalence. Use GENERALIZED COLUMN and TABLE NAMES. Specify any necessary conditions based on the database schema. Present the rule clearly, indicating both the equivalence and the conditions under which it holds.



Example Equivalence Rules:

<Rule>
Equivalent Queries:
SELECT c1 from t1 WHERE ...;
SELECT c1 FROM t1 WHERE ...;
Schema Conditions:
None.
</Rule>



# Guidelines:
- Make SURE complete to every step PERFECTLY without ANY Mistakes
- Follow the Rules I Gave you and Remember to AVOID generating repeated equivalence rules in the examples I gave you.
- Be sure to format your response like the example equivalence rules I gave you.
- Put <New Rule></New Rule> around the new equivalence rule that you think of. Do not use other formatting around the equivalent queries.
- Use GENERALIZED COLUMN AND TABLE NAMES in any EQUIVALENCE RULE YOU WRITE. DO NOT USE THE SAME NAMES IN THE PROVIDED QUERY PAIRS!!!!
- If the two queries are not logically equivalent, say <New Rule> Not equivalent </New Rule>.
- If the new equivalence rule is already repeated in the examples listed, say <New Rule> Rule exists </New Rule>.
- The new rule should be be MINIMAL to CLEARLY demonstrate the highlighted semantic difference. Use ellipses to shorten SQL queries where necessary to achieve this.

Take a Deep Breath and Carefully Follow the Rules, Guides and Examples I gave you. I will tip you $2000 if you do EVERYTHING Perfectly.

INFO:root:model: gpt-4o
INFO:root:prompt: You are an expert SQL engineer with 20+ years of experience. You will be given some SQL equivalence rules conditional on some database schemas. You will then be given a pair of SQL queries, consisting of a gold query and a machine-generated query, and a database schema that defines the context of the queries. 

Your task is to compare the two provided SQL queries on logical equivalence and generate one more equivalence rule in the same format as the provided example equivalence rules.

Please make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please also keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.



Evaluation Criteria:

Logical equivalence - the alignment between the gold SQL query and the machine-generated SQL query. A machine-generated SQL query is logically equivalent to the gold query if these two queries would RETURN THE SAME RESULTS AND IN THE SAME ORDER for ALL POSSIBLE DATABASE INSTANCES that satisfy the provided database schema for these queries. Annotators were asked to penalize machine-generated queries that overlooked edge cases that the gold queries would have caught otherwise.



Evaluation steps:

1. Understand the Database Schema: Identify all tables used in both queries. List all columns referenced, along with their data types and constraints. Determine primary and foreign key relationships. Note any indexes or unique constraints that may affect query execution.
2. Parse and Break Down Each Query: Identify selected columns, functions, and expressions. Note the tables involved and the join conditions. Understand the filtering conditions applied. Identify grouping and aggregate conditions, if any. Determine if result ordering affects equivalence.
3. Compare Query Components: Check if both queries use the same tables and join conditions. Compare filtering conditions in the WHERE clauses. Assess whether the same columns and expressions are selected. Identify if different functions or syntaxes achieve the same result. Look for logical equivalence in expressions and calculations.
4. Consider Edge Cases and Data Variations: Conceptualize sample datasets that include edge cases (e.g., NULL values, zero values, special characters). Analyze how each query handles these edge cases. Ensure that data type differences do not affect the outcome. Verify that constraints (e.g., NOT NULL, UNIQUE) are accounted for.
5. Evaluate Aggregations and Calculations: Confirm that aggregate functions (e.g., SUM, COUNT) are applied identically. Ensure calculations (e.g., subtraction, addition) produce the same results.
6. Check for Logical Equivalence in Conditional Expressions: Compare conditional expressions like IIF, CASE WHEN, and IF. Determine if conditions and returned values are logically the same.
7. Assess Ordering of Results: If ORDER BY clause is present, confirm that both queries order results identically. Recognize that differing order may affect equivalence if result order is significant.
8. Generate a New Logical Equivalence Rule (If Applicable): Create an "Equivalent Queries: <query1>
<query2>
Schema Conditions:<conditions>" statement that defines the equivalence. Use GENERALIZED COLUMN and TABLE NAMES. Specify any necessary conditions based on the database schema. Present the rule clearly, indicating both the equivalence and the conditions under which it holds.



Example Equivalence Rules:

<Rule>
Equivalent Queries:
SELECT c1 from t1 WHERE ...;
SELECT c1 FROM t1 WHERE ...;
Schema Conditions:
None.
</Rule>



# Guidelines:
- Make SURE complete to every step PERFECTLY without ANY Mistakes
- Follow the Rules I Gave you and Remember to AVOID generating repeated equivalence rules in the examples I gave you.
- Be sure to format your response like the example equivalence rules I gave you.
- Put <New Rule></New Rule> around the new equivalence rule that you think of. Do not use other formatting around the equivalent queries.
- Use GENERALIZED COLUMN AND TABLE NAMES in any EQUIVALENCE RULE YOU WRITE. DO NOT USE THE SAME NAMES IN THE PROVIDED QUERY PAIRS!!!!
- If the two queries are not logically equivalent, say <New Rule> Not equivalent </New Rule>.
- If the new equivalence rule is already repeated in the examples listed, say <New Rule> Rule exists </New Rule>.
- The new rule should be be MINIMAL to CLEARLY demonstrate the highlighted semantic difference. Use ellipses to shorten SQL queries where necessary to achieve this.

Take a Deep Breath and Carefully Follow the Rules, Guides and Examples I gave you. I will tip you $2000 if you do EVERYTHING Perfectly.

THEN 1 ELSE 0 END` is logically equivalent to `COUNT` with `CASE WHEN ... THEN column END` when counting occurrences.\n\n### Step 5: Evaluate Aggregations and Calculations\n\n- The aggregation logic in both queries effectively counts the number of races in Germany and divides by the total number of races with the specified name.\n\n### Step 6: Check for Logical Equivalence in Conditional Expressions\n\n- The conditional expressions used in both queries are logically equivalent in their context.\n\n### Step 7: Assess Ordering of Results\n\n- Neither query specifies an `ORDER BY` clause. The order of results is not significant for equivalence in this context.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe machine-generated query is logically equivalent to the gold query. The difference in syntax (`SUM` with `CASE WHEN ... THEN 1 ELSE 0 END` vs. `COUNT` with `CASE WHEN ... THEN column END`) achieves the same result.\n\n### Step 8: Generate a New Logical Equivalence Rule\n\n<New Rule>\nEquivalent Queries:\nSELECT CAST(COUNT(CASE WHEN t1.c1 = 'value' THEN t2.c2 END) AS REAL) * 100 / COUNT(t2.c2) FROM t1 INNER JOIN t2 ON t2.c3 = t1.c3 WHERE t2.c4 = 'value';\nSELECT CAST(SUM(CASE WHEN t1.c1 = 'value' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS REAL) * 100 / COUNT(t2.c2) FROM t2 INNER JOIN t1 ON t2.c3 = t1.c3 WHERE t2.c4 = 'value';\nSchema Conditions:\nNone.\n", role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None, refusal=None))], created=1732078264, model='gpt-4o-2024-08-06', object='chat.completion', system_fingerprint='fp_831e067d82', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=778, prompt_tokens=2254, total_tokens=3032, prompt_tokens_details={'cached_tokens': 0, 'audio_tokens': 0}, completion_tokens_details={'reasoning_tokens': 0, 'audio_tokens': 0, 'accepted_prediction_tokens': 0, 'rejected_prediction_tokens': 0}))

INFO:root:model: gpt-4o
INFO:root:prompt: You are an expert SQL engineer with 20+ years of experience. You will be given some SQL equivalence rules conditional on some database schemas. You will then be given a pair of SQL queries, consisting of a gold query and a machine-generated query, and a database schema that defines the context of the queries. 

Your task is to compare the two provided SQL queries on logical equivalence and generate one more equivalence rule in the same format as the provided example equivalence rules.

Please make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please also keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.



Evaluation Criteria:

Logical equivalence - the alignment between the gold SQL query and the machine-generated SQL query. A machine-generated SQL query is logically equivalent to the gold query if these two queries would RETURN THE SAME RESULTS AND IN THE SAME ORDER for ALL POSSIBLE DATABASE INSTANCES that satisfy the provided database schema for these queries. Annotators were asked to penalize machine-generated queries that overlooked edge cases that the gold queries would have caught otherwise.



Evaluation steps:

1. Understand the Database Schema: Identify all tables used in both queries. List all columns referenced, along with their data types and constraints. Determine primary and foreign key relationships. Note any indexes or unique constraints that may affect query execution.
2. Parse and Break Down Each Query: Identify selected columns, functions, and expressions. Note the tables involved and the join conditions. Understand the filtering conditions applied. Identify grouping and aggregate conditions, if any. Determine if result ordering affects equivalence.
3. Compare Query Components: Check if both queries use the same tables and join conditions. Compare filtering conditions in the WHERE clauses. Assess whether the same columns and expressions are selected. Identify if different functions or syntaxes achieve the same result. Look for logical equivalence in expressions and calculations.
4. Consider Edge Cases and Data Variations: Conceptualize sample datasets that include edge cases (e.g., NULL values, zero values, special characters). Analyze how each query handles these edge cases. Ensure that data type differences do not affect the outcome. Verify that constraints (e.g., NOT NULL, UNIQUE) are accounted for.
5. Evaluate Aggregations and Calculations: Confirm that aggregate functions (e.g., SUM, COUNT) are applied identically. Ensure calculations (e.g., subtraction, addition) produce the same results.
6. Check for Logical Equivalence in Conditional Expressions: Compare conditional expressions like IIF, CASE WHEN, and IF. Determine if conditions and returned values are logically the same.
7. Assess Ordering of Results: If ORDER BY clause is present, confirm that both queries order results identically. Recognize that differing order may affect equivalence if result order is significant.
8. Generate a New Logical Equivalence Rule (If Applicable): Create an "Equivalent Queries: <query1>
<query2>
Schema Conditions:<conditions>" statement that defines the equivalence. Use GENERALIZED COLUMN and TABLE NAMES. Specify any necessary conditions based on the database schema. Present the rule clearly, indicating both the equivalence and the conditions under which it holds.



Example Equivalence Rules:

<Rule>
Equivalent Queries:
SELECT c1 from t1 WHERE ...;
SELECT c1 FROM t1 WHERE ...;
Schema Conditions:
None.
</Rule>



# Guidelines:
- Make SURE complete to every step PERFECTLY without ANY Mistakes
- Follow the Rules I Gave you and Remember to AVOID generating repeated equivalence rules in the examples I gave you.
- Be sure to format your response like the example equivalence rules I gave you.
- Put <New Rule></New Rule> around the new equivalence rule that you think of. Do not use other formatting around the equivalent queries.
- Use GENERALIZED COLUMN AND TABLE NAMES in any EQUIVALENCE RULE YOU WRITE. DO NOT USE THE SAME NAMES IN THE PROVIDED QUERY PAIRS!!!!
- If the two queries are not logically equivalent, say <New Rule> Not equivalent </New Rule>.
- If the new equivalence rule is already repeated in the examples listed, say <New Rule> Rule exists </New Rule>.
- The new rule should be be MINIMAL to CLEARLY demonstrate the highlighted semantic difference. Use ellipses to shorten SQL queries where necessary to achieve this.

Take a Deep Breath and Carefully Follow the Rules, Guides and Examples I gave you. I will tip you $2000 if you do EVERYTHING Perfectly.

INFO:root:model: gpt-4o
INFO:root:prompt: You are an expert SQL engineer with 20+ years of experience. You will be given some SQL equivalence rules conditional on some database schemas. You will then be given a pair of SQL queries, consisting of a gold query and a machine-generated query, and a database schema that defines the context of the queries. 

Your task is to compare the two provided SQL queries on logical equivalence and generate one more equivalence rule in the same format as the provided example equivalence rules.

Please make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please also keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.



Evaluation Criteria:

Logical equivalence - the alignment between the gold SQL query and the machine-generated SQL query. A machine-generated SQL query is logically equivalent to the gold query if these two queries would RETURN THE SAME RESULTS AND IN THE SAME ORDER for ALL POSSIBLE DATABASE INSTANCES that satisfy the provided database schema for these queries. Annotators were asked to penalize machine-generated queries that overlooked edge cases that the gold queries would have caught otherwise.



Evaluation steps:

1. Understand the Database Schema: Identify all tables used in both queries. List all columns referenced, along with their data types and constraints. Determine primary and foreign key relationships. Note any indexes or unique constraints that may affect query execution.
2. Parse and Break Down Each Query: Identify selected columns, functions, and expressions. Note the tables involved and the join conditions. Understand the filtering conditions applied. Identify grouping and aggregate conditions, if any. Determine if result ordering affects equivalence.
3. Compare Query Components: Check if both queries use the same tables and join conditions. Compare filtering conditions in the WHERE clauses. Assess whether the same columns and expressions are selected. Identify if different functions or syntaxes achieve the same result. Look for logical equivalence in expressions and calculations.
4. Consider Edge Cases and Data Variations: Conceptualize sample datasets that include edge cases (e.g., NULL values, zero values, special characters). Analyze how each query handles these edge cases. Ensure that data type differences do not affect the outcome. Verify that constraints (e.g., NOT NULL, UNIQUE) are accounted for.
5. Evaluate Aggregations and Calculations: Confirm that aggregate functions (e.g., SUM, COUNT) are applied identically. Ensure calculations (e.g., subtraction, addition) produce the same results.
6. Check for Logical Equivalence in Conditional Expressions: Compare conditional expressions like IIF, CASE WHEN, and IF. Determine if conditions and returned values are logically the same.
7. Assess Ordering of Results: If ORDER BY clause is present, confirm that both queries order results identically. Recognize that differing order may affect equivalence if result order is significant.
8. Generate a New Logical Equivalence Rule (If Applicable): Create an "Equivalent Queries: <query1>
<query2>
Schema Conditions:<conditions>" statement that defines the equivalence. Use GENERALIZED COLUMN and TABLE NAMES. Specify any necessary conditions based on the database schema. Present the rule clearly, indicating both the equivalence and the conditions under which it holds.



Example Equivalence Rules:

<Rule>
Equivalent Queries:
SELECT c1 from t1 WHERE ...;
SELECT c1 FROM t1 WHERE ...;
Schema Conditions:
None.
</Rule>



# Guidelines:
- Make SURE complete to every step PERFECTLY without ANY Mistakes
- Follow the Rules I Gave you and Remember to AVOID generating repeated equivalence rules in the examples I gave you.
- Be sure to format your response like the example equivalence rules I gave you.
- Put <New Rule></New Rule> around the new equivalence rule that you think of. Do not use other formatting around the equivalent queries.
- Use GENERALIZED COLUMN AND TABLE NAMES in any EQUIVALENCE RULE YOU WRITE. DO NOT USE THE SAME NAMES IN THE PROVIDED QUERY PAIRS!!!!
- If the two queries are not logically equivalent, say <New Rule> Not equivalent </New Rule>.
- If the new equivalence rule is already repeated in the examples listed, say <New Rule> Rule exists </New Rule>.
- The new rule should be be MINIMAL to CLEARLY demonstrate the highlighted semantic difference. Use ellipses to shorten SQL queries where necessary to achieve this.

Take a Deep Breath and Carefully Follow the Rules, Guides and Examples I gave you. I will tip you $2000 if you do EVERYTHING Perfectly.

INFO:root:model: gpt-4o
INFO:root:prompt: You are an expert SQL engineer with 20+ years of experience. You will be given some SQL equivalence rules conditional on some database schemas. You will then be given a pair of SQL queries, consisting of a gold query and a machine-generated query, and a database schema that defines the context of the queries. 

Your task is to compare the two provided SQL queries on logical equivalence and generate one more equivalence rule in the same format as the provided example equivalence rules.

Please make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please also keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.



Evaluation Criteria:

Logical equivalence - the alignment between the gold SQL query and the machine-generated SQL query. A machine-generated SQL query is logically equivalent to the gold query if these two queries would RETURN THE SAME RESULTS AND IN THE SAME ORDER for ALL POSSIBLE DATABASE INSTANCES that satisfy the provided database schema for these queries. Annotators were asked to penalize machine-generated queries that overlooked edge cases that the gold queries would have caught otherwise.



Evaluation steps:

1. Understand the Database Schema: Identify all tables used in both queries. List all columns referenced, along with their data types and constraints. Determine primary and foreign key relationships. Note any indexes or unique constraints that may affect query execution.
2. Parse and Break Down Each Query: Identify selected columns, functions, and expressions. Note the tables involved and the join conditions. Understand the filtering conditions applied. Identify grouping and aggregate conditions, if any. Determine if result ordering affects equivalence.
3. Compare Query Components: Check if both queries use the same tables and join conditions. Compare filtering conditions in the WHERE clauses. Assess whether the same columns and expressions are selected. Identify if different functions or syntaxes achieve the same result. Look for logical equivalence in expressions and calculations.
4. Consider Edge Cases and Data Variations: Conceptualize sample datasets that include edge cases (e.g., NULL values, zero values, special characters). Analyze how each query handles these edge cases. Ensure that data type differences do not affect the outcome. Verify that constraints (e.g., NOT NULL, UNIQUE) are accounted for.
5. Evaluate Aggregations and Calculations: Confirm that aggregate functions (e.g., SUM, COUNT) are applied identically. Ensure calculations (e.g., subtraction, addition) produce the same results.
6. Check for Logical Equivalence in Conditional Expressions: Compare conditional expressions like IIF, CASE WHEN, and IF. Determine if conditions and returned values are logically the same.
7. Assess Ordering of Results: If ORDER BY clause is present, confirm that both queries order results identically. Recognize that differing order may affect equivalence if result order is significant.
8. Generate a New Logical Equivalence Rule (If Applicable): Create an "Equivalent Queries: <query1>
<query2>
Schema Conditions:<conditions>" statement that defines the equivalence. Use GENERALIZED COLUMN and TABLE NAMES. Specify any necessary conditions based on the database schema. Present the rule clearly, indicating both the equivalence and the conditions under which it holds.



Example Equivalence Rules:

<Rule>
Equivalent Queries:
SELECT c1 from t1 WHERE ...;
SELECT c1 FROM t1 WHERE ...;
Schema Conditions:
None.
</Rule>



# Guidelines:
- Make SURE complete to every step PERFECTLY without ANY Mistakes
- Follow the Rules I Gave you and Remember to AVOID generating repeated equivalence rules in the examples I gave you.
- Be sure to format your response like the example equivalence rules I gave you.
- Put <New Rule></New Rule> around the new equivalence rule that you think of. Do not use other formatting around the equivalent queries.
- Use GENERALIZED COLUMN AND TABLE NAMES in any EQUIVALENCE RULE YOU WRITE. DO NOT USE THE SAME NAMES IN THE PROVIDED QUERY PAIRS!!!!
- If the two queries are not logically equivalent, say <New Rule> Not equivalent </New Rule>.
- If the new equivalence rule is already repeated in the examples listed, say <New Rule> Rule exists </New Rule>.
- The new rule should be be MINIMAL to CLEARLY demonstrate the highlighted semantic difference. Use ellipses to shorten SQL queries where necessary to achieve this.

Take a Deep Breath and Carefully Follow the Rules, Guides and Examples I gave you. I will tip you $2000 if you do EVERYTHING Perfectly.



Pair of SQL Queries:
<Gold SQL Query>
SELECT AVG(T1.fastestLapSpeed) FROM results AS T1 INNER JOIN races AS T2 on T1.raceId = T2.raceId WHERE T2.year = 2009 AND T2.name = 'Spanish Grand Prix';
</Gold SQL Query>

<Machine-generated SQL Query>
SELECT avg(results.fastestlapspeed) FROM races INNER JOIN results ON races.raceid = results.raceid WHERE races.name = 'Spanish Grand Prix' AND races.year = 2009;
</Machine-generated SQL Query>

INFO:root:prompt: You are an expert SQL engineer with 20+ years of experience. You will be given some SQL equivalence rules conditional on some database schemas. You will then be given a pair of SQL queries, consisting of a gold query and a machine-generated query, and a database schema that defines the context of the queries. 

Your task is to compare the two provided SQL queries on logical equivalence and generate one more equivalence rule in the same format as the provided example equivalence rules.

Please make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please also keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.



Evaluation Criteria:

Logical equivalence - the alignment between the gold SQL query and the machine-generated SQL query. A machine-generated SQL query is logically equivalent to the gold query if these two queries would RETURN THE SAME RESULTS AND IN THE SAME ORDER for ALL POSSIBLE DATABASE INSTANCES that satisfy the provided database schema for these queries. Annotators were asked to penalize machine-generated queries that overlooked edge cases that the gold queries would have caught otherwise.



Evaluation steps:

1. Understand the Database Schema: Identify all tables used in both queries. List all columns referenced, along with their data types and constraints. Determine primary and foreign key relationships. Note any indexes or unique constraints that may affect query execution.
2. Parse and Break Down Each Query: Identify selected columns, functions, and expressions. Note the tables involved and the join conditions. Understand the filtering conditions applied. Identify grouping and aggregate conditions, if any. Determine if result ordering affects equivalence.
3. Compare Query Components: Check if both queries use the same tables and join conditions. Compare filtering conditions in the WHERE clauses. Assess whether the same columns and expressions are selected. Identify if different functions or syntaxes achieve the same result. Look for logical equivalence in expressions and calculations.
4. Consider Edge Cases and Data Variations: Conceptualize sample datasets that include edge cases (e.g., NULL values, zero values, special characters). Analyze how each query handles these edge cases. Ensure that data type differences do not affect the outcome. Verify that constraints (e.g., NOT NULL, UNIQUE) are accounted for.
5. Evaluate Aggregations and Calculations: Confirm that aggregate functions (e.g., SUM, COUNT) are applied identically. Ensure calculations (e.g., subtraction, addition) produce the same results.
6. Check for Logical Equivalence in Conditional Expressions: Compare conditional expressions like IIF, CASE WHEN, and IF. Determine if conditions and returned values are logically the same.
7. Assess Ordering of Results: If ORDER BY clause is present, confirm that both queries order results identically. Recognize that differing order may affect equivalence if result order is significant.
8. Generate a New Logical Equivalence Rule (If Applicable): Create an "Equivalent Queries: <query1>
<query2>
Schema Conditions:<conditions>" statement that defines the equivalence. Use GENERALIZED COLUMN and TABLE NAMES. Specify any necessary conditions based on the database schema. Present the rule clearly, indicating both the equivalence and the conditions under which it holds.



Example Equivalence Rules:

<Rule>
Equivalent Queries:
SELECT c1 from t1 WHERE ...;
SELECT c1 FROM t1 WHERE ...;
Schema Conditions:
None.
</Rule>



# Guidelines:
- Make SURE complete to every step PERFECTLY without ANY Mistakes
- Follow the Rules I Gave you and Remember to AVOID generating repeated equivalence rules in the examples I gave you.
- Be sure to format your response like the example equivalence rules I gave you.
- Put <New Rule></New Rule> around the new equivalence rule that you think of. Do not use other formatting around the equivalent queries.
- Use GENERALIZED COLUMN AND TABLE NAMES in any EQUIVALENCE RULE YOU WRITE. DO NOT USE THE SAME NAMES IN THE PROVIDED QUERY PAIRS!!!!
- If the two queries are not logically equivalent, say <New Rule> Not equivalent </New Rule>.
- If the new equivalence rule is already repeated in the examples listed, say <New Rule> Rule exists </New Rule>.
- The new rule should be be MINIMAL to CLEARLY demonstrate the highlighted semantic difference. Use ellipses to shorten SQL queries where necessary to achieve this.

Take a Deep Breath and Carefully Follow the Rules, Guides and Examples I gave you. I will tip you $2000 if you do EVERYTHING Perfectly.

INFO:root:prompt: You are an expert SQL engineer with 20+ years of experience. You will be given some SQL equivalence rules conditional on some database schemas. You will then be given a pair of SQL queries, consisting of a gold query and a machine-generated query, and a database schema that defines the context of the queries. 

Your task is to compare the two provided SQL queries on logical equivalence and generate one more equivalence rule in the same format as the provided example equivalence rules.

Please make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please also keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.



Evaluation Criteria:

Logical equivalence - the alignment between the gold SQL query and the machine-generated SQL query. A machine-generated SQL query is logically equivalent to the gold query if these two queries would RETURN THE SAME RESULTS AND IN THE SAME ORDER for ALL POSSIBLE DATABASE INSTANCES that satisfy the provided database schema for these queries. Annotators were asked to penalize machine-generated queries that overlooked edge cases that the gold queries would have caught otherwise.



Evaluation steps:

1. Understand the Database Schema: Identify all tables used in both queries. List all columns referenced, along with their data types and constraints. Determine primary and foreign key relationships. Note any indexes or unique constraints that may affect query execution.
2. Parse and Break Down Each Query: Identify selected columns, functions, and expressions. Note the tables involved and the join conditions. Understand the filtering conditions applied. Identify grouping and aggregate conditions, if any. Determine if result ordering affects equivalence.
3. Compare Query Components: Check if both queries use the same tables and join conditions. Compare filtering conditions in the WHERE clauses. Assess whether the same columns and expressions are selected. Identify if different functions or syntaxes achieve the same result. Look for logical equivalence in expressions and calculations.
4. Consider Edge Cases and Data Variations: Conceptualize sample datasets that include edge cases (e.g., NULL values, zero values, special characters). Analyze how each query handles these edge cases. Ensure that data type differences do not affect the outcome. Verify that constraints (e.g., NOT NULL, UNIQUE) are accounted for.
5. Evaluate Aggregations and Calculations: Confirm that aggregate functions (e.g., SUM, COUNT) are applied identically. Ensure calculations (e.g., subtraction, addition) produce the same results.
6. Check for Logical Equivalence in Conditional Expressions: Compare conditional expressions like IIF, CASE WHEN, and IF. Determine if conditions and returned values are logically the same.
7. Assess Ordering of Results: If ORDER BY clause is present, confirm that both queries order results identically. Recognize that differing order may affect equivalence if result order is significant.
8. Generate a New Logical Equivalence Rule (If Applicable): Create an "Equivalent Queries: <query1>
<query2>
Schema Conditions:<conditions>" statement that defines the equivalence. Use GENERALIZED COLUMN and TABLE NAMES. Specify any necessary conditions based on the database schema. Present the rule clearly, indicating both the equivalence and the conditions under which it holds.



Example Equivalence Rules:

<Rule>
Equivalent Queries:
SELECT c1 from t1 WHERE ...;
SELECT c1 FROM t1 WHERE ...;
Schema Conditions:
None.
</Rule>



# Guidelines:
- Make SURE complete to every step PERFECTLY without ANY Mistakes
- Follow the Rules I Gave you and Remember to AVOID generating repeated equivalence rules in the examples I gave you.
- Be sure to format your response like the example equivalence rules I gave you.
- Put <New Rule></New Rule> around the new equivalence rule that you think of. Do not use other formatting around the equivalent queries.
- Use GENERALIZED COLUMN AND TABLE NAMES in any EQUIVALENCE RULE YOU WRITE. DO NOT USE THE SAME NAMES IN THE PROVIDED QUERY PAIRS!!!!
- If the two queries are not logically equivalent, say <New Rule> Not equivalent </New Rule>.
- If the new equivalence rule is already repeated in the examples listed, say <New Rule> Rule exists </New Rule>.
- The new rule should be be MINIMAL to CLEARLY demonstrate the highlighted semantic difference. Use ellipses to shorten SQL queries where necessary to achieve this.

Take a Deep Breath and Carefully Follow the Rules, Guides and Examples I gave you. I will tip you $2000 if you do EVERYTHING Perfectly.

INFO:root:model: gpt-4o
INFO:root:prompt: You are an expert SQL engineer with 20+ years of experience. You will be given some SQL equivalence rules conditional on some database schemas. You will then be given a pair of SQL queries, consisting of a gold query and a machine-generated query, and a database schema that defines the context of the queries. 

Your task is to compare the two provided SQL queries on logical equivalence and generate one more equivalence rule in the same format as the provided example equivalence rules.

Please make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please also keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.



Evaluation Criteria:

Logical equivalence - the alignment between the gold SQL query and the machine-generated SQL query. A machine-generated SQL query is logically equivalent to the gold query if these two queries would RETURN THE SAME RESULTS AND IN THE SAME ORDER for ALL POSSIBLE DATABASE INSTANCES that satisfy the provided database schema for these queries. Annotators were asked to penalize machine-generated queries that overlooked edge cases that the gold queries would have caught otherwise.



Evaluation steps:

1. Understand the Database Schema: Identify all tables used in both queries. List all columns referenced, along with their data types and constraints. Determine primary and foreign key relationships. Note any indexes or unique constraints that may affect query execution.
2. Parse and Break Down Each Query: Identify selected columns, functions, and expressions. Note the tables involved and the join conditions. Understand the filtering conditions applied. Identify grouping and aggregate conditions, if any. Determine if result ordering affects equivalence.
3. Compare Query Components: Check if both queries use the same tables and join conditions. Compare filtering conditions in the WHERE clauses. Assess whether the same columns and expressions are selected. Identify if different functions or syntaxes achieve the same result. Look for logical equivalence in expressions and calculations.
4. Consider Edge Cases and Data Variations: Conceptualize sample datasets that include edge cases (e.g., NULL values, zero values, special characters). Analyze how each query handles these edge cases. Ensure that data type differences do not affect the outcome. Verify that constraints (e.g., NOT NULL, UNIQUE) are accounted for.
5. Evaluate Aggregations and Calculations: Confirm that aggregate functions (e.g., SUM, COUNT) are applied identically. Ensure calculations (e.g., subtraction, addition) produce the same results.
6. Check for Logical Equivalence in Conditional Expressions: Compare conditional expressions like IIF, CASE WHEN, and IF. Determine if conditions and returned values are logically the same.
7. Assess Ordering of Results: If ORDER BY clause is present, confirm that both queries order results identically. Recognize that differing order may affect equivalence if result order is significant.
8. Generate a New Logical Equivalence Rule (If Applicable): Create an "Equivalent Queries: <query1>
<query2>
Schema Conditions:<conditions>" statement that defines the equivalence. Use GENERALIZED COLUMN and TABLE NAMES. Specify any necessary conditions based on the database schema. Present the rule clearly, indicating both the equivalence and the conditions under which it holds.



Example Equivalence Rules:

<Rule>
Equivalent Queries:
SELECT c1 from t1 WHERE ...;
SELECT c1 FROM t1 WHERE ...;
Schema Conditions:
None.
</Rule>



# Guidelines:
- Make SURE complete to every step PERFECTLY without ANY Mistakes
- Follow the Rules I Gave you and Remember to AVOID generating repeated equivalence rules in the examples I gave you.
- Be sure to format your response like the example equivalence rules I gave you.
- Put <New Rule></New Rule> around the new equivalence rule that you think of. Do not use other formatting around the equivalent queries.
- Use GENERALIZED COLUMN AND TABLE NAMES in any EQUIVALENCE RULE YOU WRITE. DO NOT USE THE SAME NAMES IN THE PROVIDED QUERY PAIRS!!!!
- If the two queries are not logically equivalent, say <New Rule> Not equivalent </New Rule>.
- If the new equivalence rule is already repeated in the examples listed, say <New Rule> Rule exists </New Rule>.
- The new rule should be be MINIMAL to CLEARLY demonstrate the highlighted semantic difference. Use ellipses to shorten SQL queries where necessary to achieve this.

Take a Deep Breath and Carefully Follow the Rules, Guides and Examples I gave you. I will tip you $2000 if you do EVERYTHING Perfectly.



Pair of SQL Queries:
<Gold SQL Query>
SELECT T1.forename, T1.surname, T1.nationality, T3.name FROM drivers AS T1 INNER JOIN driverStandings AS T2 on T1.driverId = T2.driverId INNER JOIN races AS T3 on T2.raceId = T3.raceId ORDER BY JULIANDAY(T1.dob) DESC LIMIT 1;
</Gold SQL Query>

<Machine-generated SQL Query>

The `JULIANDAY` function converts a date to a Julian day number, which is a numeric representation.\n- Since `dob` is already a date, ordering by `dob` directly or by `JULIANDAY(dob)` should yield the same order. Therefore, the two queries are logically equivalent in terms of ordering.\n\n### Step 5: Evaluate Aggregations and Calculations\n\n- No aggregate functions are used in either query.\n\n### Step 6: Check for Logical Equivalence in Conditional Expressions\n\n- There are no conditional expressions like `IIF`, `CASE WHEN`, or `IF` in either query.\n\n### Step 7: Assess Ordering of Results\n\n- Both queries limit the result to one row after ordering, and the order logic is equivalent.\n\n### Step 8: Generate a New Logical Equivalence Rule (If Applicable)\n\nThe difference in the `ORDER BY` clause using `JULIANDAY` does not affect the logical equivalence of the queries as both achieve the same result. Therefore, these queries are equivalent.\n\n<New Rule>\nEquivalent Queries:\nSELECT ... FROM ... ORDER BY JULIANDAY(...);\nSELECT ... FROM ...

INFO:root:prompt: You are an expert SQL engineer with 20+ years of experience. You will be given some SQL equivalence rules conditional on some database schemas. You will then be given a pair of SQL queries, consisting of a gold query and a machine-generated query, and a database schema that defines the context of the queries. 

Your task is to compare the two provided SQL queries on logical equivalence and generate one more equivalence rule in the same format as the provided example equivalence rules.

Please make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please also keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.



Evaluation Criteria:

Logical equivalence - the alignment between the gold SQL query and the machine-generated SQL query. A machine-generated SQL query is logically equivalent to the gold query if these two queries would RETURN THE SAME RESULTS AND IN THE SAME ORDER for ALL POSSIBLE DATABASE INSTANCES that satisfy the provided database schema for these queries. Annotators were asked to penalize machine-generated queries that overlooked edge cases that the gold queries would have caught otherwise.



Evaluation steps:

1. Understand the Database Schema: Identify all tables used in both queries. List all columns referenced, along with their data types and constraints. Determine primary and foreign key relationships. Note any indexes or unique constraints that may affect query execution.
2. Parse and Break Down Each Query: Identify selected columns, functions, and expressions. Note the tables involved and the join conditions. Understand the filtering conditions applied. Identify grouping and aggregate conditions, if any. Determine if result ordering affects equivalence.
3. Compare Query Components: Check if both queries use the same tables and join conditions. Compare filtering conditions in the WHERE clauses. Assess whether the same columns and expressions are selected. Identify if different functions or syntaxes achieve the same result. Look for logical equivalence in expressions and calculations.
4. Consider Edge Cases and Data Variations: Conceptualize sample datasets that include edge cases (e.g., NULL values, zero values, special characters). Analyze how each query handles these edge cases. Ensure that data type differences do not affect the outcome. Verify that constraints (e.g., NOT NULL, UNIQUE) are accounted for.
5. Evaluate Aggregations and Calculations: Confirm that aggregate functions (e.g., SUM, COUNT) are applied identically. Ensure calculations (e.g., subtraction, addition) produce the same results.
6. Check for Logical Equivalence in Conditional Expressions: Compare conditional expressions like IIF, CASE WHEN, and IF. Determine if conditions and returned values are logically the same.
7. Assess Ordering of Results: If ORDER BY clause is present, confirm that both queries order results identically. Recognize that differing order may affect equivalence if result order is significant.
8. Generate a New Logical Equivalence Rule (If Applicable): Create an "Equivalent Queries: <query1>
<query2>
Schema Conditions:<conditions>" statement that defines the equivalence. Use GENERALIZED COLUMN and TABLE NAMES. Specify any necessary conditions based on the database schema. Present the rule clearly, indicating both the equivalence and the conditions under which it holds.



Example Equivalence Rules:

<Rule>
Equivalent Queries:
SELECT c1 from t1 WHERE ...;
SELECT c1 FROM t1 WHERE ...;
Schema Conditions:
None.
</Rule>



# Guidelines:
- Make SURE complete to every step PERFECTLY without ANY Mistakes
- Follow the Rules I Gave you and Remember to AVOID generating repeated equivalence rules in the examples I gave you.
- Be sure to format your response like the example equivalence rules I gave you.
- Put <New Rule></New Rule> around the new equivalence rule that you think of. Do not use other formatting around the equivalent queries.
- Use GENERALIZED COLUMN AND TABLE NAMES in any EQUIVALENCE RULE YOU WRITE. DO NOT USE THE SAME NAMES IN THE PROVIDED QUERY PAIRS!!!!
- If the two queries are not logically equivalent, say <New Rule> Not equivalent </New Rule>.
- If the new equivalence rule is already repeated in the examples listed, say <New Rule> Rule exists </New Rule>.
- The new rule should be be MINIMAL to CLEARLY demonstrate the highlighted semantic difference. Use ellipses to shorten SQL queries where necessary to achieve this.

Take a Deep Breath and Carefully Follow the Rules, Guides and Examples I gave you. I will tip you $2000 if you do EVERYTHING Perfectly.

They will return the same results for all possible database instances that satisfy the provided schema.\n\n### Step 8: Generate a New Logical Equivalence Rule\nSince the provided queries are logically equivalent and there is no existing rule in the examples that matches this specific case, we can generate a new equivalence rule.\n\n<New Rule>\nEquivalent Queries:\nSELECT COUNT(t1.c1) FROM t1 INNER JOIN t2 ON t1.c1 = t2.c2 INNER JOIN t3 ON t2.c3 = t3.c1 INNER JOIN t4 ON t1.c4 = t4.c1 WHERE t3.c5 = 'value1' AND t4.c6 = 'value2';\nSELECT COUNT(t1.c1) FROM t1 INNER JOIN t2 ON t1.c1 = t2.c2 INNER JOIN t3 ON t2.c3 = t3.c1 INNER JOIN t4 ON t1.c4 = t4.c1 WHERE t4.c6 = 'value2' AND t3.c5 = 'value1';\nSchema Conditions:\nNone.\n", role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None, refusal=None))], created=1732078542, model='gpt-4o-2024-08-06', object='chat.completion', system_fingerprint='fp_831e067d82', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=754, prompt_tokens=1538, total_tokens=2292, prompt_tokens_details={'cached_tokens': 0, 'audio_tokens': 0}, completion_tokens_details={'reasoning_tokens': 0, 'audio_tokens': 0, 'accepted_prediction_tokens': 0, 'rejected_prediction_tokens': 0}))

INFO:root:prompt: You are an expert SQL engineer with 20+ years of experience. You will be given some SQL equivalence rules conditional on some database schemas. You will then be given a pair of SQL queries, consisting of a gold query and a machine-generated query, and a database schema that defines the context of the queries. 

Your task is to compare the two provided SQL queries on logical equivalence and generate one more equivalence rule in the same format as the provided example equivalence rules.

Please make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please also keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.



Evaluation Criteria:

Logical equivalence - the alignment between the gold SQL query and the machine-generated SQL query. A machine-generated SQL query is logically equivalent to the gold query if these two queries would RETURN THE SAME RESULTS AND IN THE SAME ORDER for ALL POSSIBLE DATABASE INSTANCES that satisfy the provided database schema for these queries. Annotators were asked to penalize machine-generated queries that overlooked edge cases that the gold queries would have caught otherwise.



Evaluation steps:

1. Understand the Database Schema: Identify all tables used in both queries. List all columns referenced, along with their data types and constraints. Determine primary and foreign key relationships. Note any indexes or unique constraints that may affect query execution.
2. Parse and Break Down Each Query: Identify selected columns, functions, and expressions. Note the tables involved and the join conditions. Understand the filtering conditions applied. Identify grouping and aggregate conditions, if any. Determine if result ordering affects equivalence.
3. Compare Query Components: Check if both queries use the same tables and join conditions. Compare filtering conditions in the WHERE clauses. Assess whether the same columns and expressions are selected. Identify if different functions or syntaxes achieve the same result. Look for logical equivalence in expressions and calculations.
4. Consider Edge Cases and Data Variations: Conceptualize sample datasets that include edge cases (e.g., NULL values, zero values, special characters). Analyze how each query handles these edge cases. Ensure that data type differences do not affect the outcome. Verify that constraints (e.g., NOT NULL, UNIQUE) are accounted for.
5. Evaluate Aggregations and Calculations: Confirm that aggregate functions (e.g., SUM, COUNT) are applied identically. Ensure calculations (e.g., subtraction, addition) produce the same results.
6. Check for Logical Equivalence in Conditional Expressions: Compare conditional expressions like IIF, CASE WHEN, and IF. Determine if conditions and returned values are logically the same.
7. Assess Ordering of Results: If ORDER BY clause is present, confirm that both queries order results identically. Recognize that differing order may affect equivalence if result order is significant.
8. Generate a New Logical Equivalence Rule (If Applicable): Create an "Equivalent Queries: <query1>
<query2>
Schema Conditions:<conditions>" statement that defines the equivalence. Use GENERALIZED COLUMN and TABLE NAMES. Specify any necessary conditions based on the database schema. Present the rule clearly, indicating both the equivalence and the conditions under which it holds.



Example Equivalence Rules:

<Rule>
Equivalent Queries:
SELECT c1 from t1 WHERE ...;
SELECT c1 FROM t1 WHERE ...;
Schema Conditions:
None.
</Rule>



# Guidelines:
- Make SURE complete to every step PERFECTLY without ANY Mistakes
- Follow the Rules I Gave you and Remember to AVOID generating repeated equivalence rules in the examples I gave you.
- Be sure to format your response like the example equivalence rules I gave you.
- Put <New Rule></New Rule> around the new equivalence rule that you think of. Do not use other formatting around the equivalent queries.
- Use GENERALIZED COLUMN AND TABLE NAMES in any EQUIVALENCE RULE YOU WRITE. DO NOT USE THE SAME NAMES IN THE PROVIDED QUERY PAIRS!!!!
- If the two queries are not logically equivalent, say <New Rule> Not equivalent </New Rule>.
- If the new equivalence rule is already repeated in the examples listed, say <New Rule> Rule exists </New Rule>.
- The new rule should be be MINIMAL to CLEARLY demonstrate the highlighted semantic difference. Use ellipses to shorten SQL queries where necessary to achieve this.

Take a Deep Breath and Carefully Follow the Rules, Guides and Examples I gave you. I will tip you $2000 if you do EVERYTHING Perfectly.

- Use GENERALIZED COLUMN AND TABLE NAMES in any EQUIVALENCE RULE YOU WRITE. DO NOT USE THE SAME NAMES IN THE PROVIDED QUERY PAIRS!!!!
- If the two queries are not logically equivalent, say <New Rule> Not equivalent </New Rule>.
- If the new equivalence rule is already repeated in the examples listed, say <New Rule> Rule exists </New Rule>.
- The new rule should be be MINIMAL to CLEARLY demonstrate the highlighted semantic difference. Use ellipses to shorten SQL queries where necessary to achieve this.

Take a Deep Breath and Carefully Follow the Rules, Guides and Examples I gave you. I will tip you $2000 if you do EVERYTHING Perfectly.

INFO:root:prompt: You are an expert SQL engineer with 20+ years of experience. You will be given some SQL equivalence rules conditional on some database schemas. You will then be given a pair of SQL queries, consisting of a gold query and a machine-generated query, and a database schema that defines the context of the queries. 

Your task is to compare the two provided SQL queries on logical equivalence and generate one more equivalence rule in the same format as the provided example equivalence rules.

Please make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please also keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.



Evaluation Criteria:

Logical equivalence - the alignment between the gold SQL query and the machine-generated SQL query. A machine-generated SQL query is logically equivalent to the gold query if these two queries would RETURN THE SAME RESULTS AND IN THE SAME ORDER for ALL POSSIBLE DATABASE INSTANCES that satisfy the provided database schema for these queries. Annotators were asked to penalize machine-generated queries that overlooked edge cases that the gold queries would have caught otherwise.



Evaluation steps:

1. Understand the Database Schema: Identify all tables used in both queries. List all columns referenced, along with their data types and constraints. Determine primary and foreign key relationships. Note any indexes or unique constraints that may affect query execution.
2. Parse and Break Down Each Query: Identify selected columns, functions, and expressions. Note the tables involved and the join conditions. Understand the filtering conditions applied. Identify grouping and aggregate conditions, if any. Determine if result ordering affects equivalence.
3. Compare Query Components: Check if both queries use the same tables and join conditions. Compare filtering conditions in the WHERE clauses. Assess whether the same columns and expressions are selected. Identify if different functions or syntaxes achieve the same result. Look for logical equivalence in expressions and calculations.
4. Consider Edge Cases and Data Variations: Conceptualize sample datasets that include edge cases (e.g., NULL values, zero values, special characters). Analyze how each query handles these edge cases. Ensure that data type differences do not affect the outcome. Verify that constraints (e.g., NOT NULL, UNIQUE) are accounted for.
5. Evaluate Aggregations and Calculations: Confirm that aggregate functions (e.g., SUM, COUNT) are applied identically. Ensure calculations (e.g., subtraction, addition) produce the same results.
6. Check for Logical Equivalence in Conditional Expressions: Compare conditional expressions like IIF, CASE WHEN, and IF. Determine if conditions and returned values are logically the same.
7. Assess Ordering of Results: If ORDER BY clause is present, confirm that both queries order results identically. Recognize that differing order may affect equivalence if result order is significant.
8. Generate a New Logical Equivalence Rule (If Applicable): Create an "Equivalent Queries: <query1>
<query2>
Schema Conditions:<conditions>" statement that defines the equivalence. Use GENERALIZED COLUMN and TABLE NAMES. Specify any necessary conditions based on the database schema. Present the rule clearly, indicating both the equivalence and the conditions under which it holds.



Example Equivalence Rules:

<Rule>
Equivalent Queries:
SELECT c1 from t1 WHERE ...;
SELECT c1 FROM t1 WHERE ...;
Schema Conditions:
None.
</Rule>



# Guidelines:
- Make SURE complete to every step PERFECTLY without ANY Mistakes
- Follow the Rules I Gave you and Remember to AVOID generating repeated equivalence rules in the examples I gave you.
- Be sure to format your response like the example equivalence rules I gave you.
- Put <New Rule></New Rule> around the new equivalence rule that you think of. Do not use other formatting around the equivalent queries.
- Use GENERALIZED COLUMN AND TABLE NAMES in any EQUIVALENCE RULE YOU WRITE. DO NOT USE THE SAME NAMES IN THE PROVIDED QUERY PAIRS!!!!
- If the two queries are not logically equivalent, say <New Rule> Not equivalent </New Rule>.
- If the new equivalence rule is already repeated in the examples listed, say <New Rule> Rule exists </New Rule>.
- The new rule should be be MINIMAL to CLEARLY demonstrate the highlighted semantic difference. Use ellipses to shorten SQL queries where necessary to achieve this.

INFO:root:prompt: You are an expert SQL engineer with 20+ years of experience. You will be given some SQL equivalence rules conditional on some database schemas. You will then be given a pair of SQL queries, consisting of a gold query and a machine-generated query, and a database schema that defines the context of the queries. 

Your task is to compare the two provided SQL queries on logical equivalence and generate one more equivalence rule in the same format as the provided example equivalence rules.

Please make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please also keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.



Evaluation Criteria:

Logical equivalence - the alignment between the gold SQL query and the machine-generated SQL query. A machine-generated SQL query is logically equivalent to the gold query if these two queries would RETURN THE SAME RESULTS AND IN THE SAME ORDER for ALL POSSIBLE DATABASE INSTANCES that satisfy the provided database schema for these queries. Annotators were asked to penalize machine-generated queries that overlooked edge cases that the gold queries would have caught otherwise.



Evaluation steps:

1. Understand the Database Schema: Identify all tables used in both queries. List all columns referenced, along with their data types and constraints. Determine primary and foreign key relationships. Note any indexes or unique constraints that may affect query execution.
2. Parse and Break Down Each Query: Identify selected columns, functions, and expressions. Note the tables involved and the join conditions. Understand the filtering conditions applied. Identify grouping and aggregate conditions, if any. Determine if result ordering affects equivalence.
3. Compare Query Components: Check if both queries use the same tables and join conditions. Compare filtering conditions in the WHERE clauses. Assess whether the same columns and expressions are selected. Identify if different functions or syntaxes achieve the same result. Look for logical equivalence in expressions and calculations.
4. Consider Edge Cases and Data Variations: Conceptualize sample datasets that include edge cases (e.g., NULL values, zero values, special characters). Analyze how each query handles these edge cases. Ensure that data type differences do not affect the outcome. Verify that constraints (e.g., NOT NULL, UNIQUE) are accounted for.
5. Evaluate Aggregations and Calculations: Confirm that aggregate functions (e.g., SUM, COUNT) are applied identically. Ensure calculations (e.g., subtraction, addition) produce the same results.
6. Check for Logical Equivalence in Conditional Expressions: Compare conditional expressions like IIF, CASE WHEN, and IF. Determine if conditions and returned values are logically the same.
7. Assess Ordering of Results: If ORDER BY clause is present, confirm that both queries order results identically. Recognize that differing order may affect equivalence if result order is significant.
8. Generate a New Logical Equivalence Rule (If Applicable): Create an "Equivalent Queries: <query1>
<query2>
Schema Conditions:<conditions>" statement that defines the equivalence. Use GENERALIZED COLUMN and TABLE NAMES. Specify any necessary conditions based on the database schema. Present the rule clearly, indicating both the equivalence and the conditions under which it holds.



Example Equivalence Rules:

<Rule>
Equivalent Queries:
SELECT c1 from t1 WHERE ...;
SELECT c1 FROM t1 WHERE ...;
Schema Conditions:
None.
</Rule>



# Guidelines:
- Make SURE complete to every step PERFECTLY without ANY Mistakes
- Follow the Rules I Gave you and Remember to AVOID generating repeated equivalence rules in the examples I gave you.
- Be sure to format your response like the example equivalence rules I gave you.
- Put <New Rule></New Rule> around the new equivalence rule that you think of. Do not use other formatting around the equivalent queries.
- Use GENERALIZED COLUMN AND TABLE NAMES in any EQUIVALENCE RULE YOU WRITE. DO NOT USE THE SAME NAMES IN THE PROVIDED QUERY PAIRS!!!!
- If the two queries are not logically equivalent, say <New Rule> Not equivalent </New Rule>.
- If the new equivalence rule is already repeated in the examples listed, say <New Rule> Rule exists </New Rule>.
- The new rule should be be MINIMAL to CLEARLY demonstrate the highlighted semantic difference. Use ellipses to shorten SQL queries where necessary to achieve this.

Take a Deep Breath and Carefully Follow the Rules, Guides and Examples I gave you. I will tip you $2000 if you do EVERYTHING Perfectly.

Let's go through them one by one.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Database Schema\n\n**Tables Involved:**\n1. `superhero`\n   - Columns: `id` (primary key), `superhero_name`, `full_name`, `gender_id`, `eye_colour_id`, `hair_colour_id`, `skin_colour_id`, `race_id`, `publisher_id`, `alignment_id`, `height_cm`, `weight_kg`\n   - Foreign keys: `gender_id`, `eye_colour_id`, `hair_colour_id`, `skin_colour_id`, `race_id`, `publisher_id`, `alignment_id`\n\n2. `hero_attribute`\n   - Columns: `hero_id`, `attribute_id`, `attribute_value`\n   - Foreign keys: `hero_id` references `superhero(id)`, `attribute_id` references `attribute(id)`\n\n3. `attribute`\n   - Columns: `id` (primary key), `attribute_name`\n\n**Primary and Foreign Key Relationships:**\n- `hero_attribute.hero_id` is a foreign key referencing `superhero.id`.\n- `hero_attribute.attribute_id` is a foreign key referencing `attribute.id`.\n\n### Step 2: Parse and Break Down Each Query\n\n**Gold SQL Query:**\n- Selects `superhero_name` from the `superhero` table.\n- Uses a subquery with `EXISTS` to check for the presence of related `hero_attribute` entries.\n- Joins `hero_attribute` and `attribute` tables to filter based on `attribute_name = 'Durability'` and `attribute_value < 50`.\n\n**Machine-generated SQL Query:**\n- Selects `superhero_name` from the `superhero` table.\n- Directly joins `superhero`, `hero_attribute`, and `attribute` tables.\n- Filters based on `attribute_name = 'Durability'` and `attribute_value < 50`.\n\n### Step 3: Compare Query Components\n\n- Both queries select `superhero_name` from the `superhero` table.\n- Both queries filter on `attribute_name = 'Durability'` and `attribute_value < 50`.\n- The gold query uses an `EXISTS` subquery, while the machine-generated query uses direct `INNER JOIN`s.\n\n### Step 4: Consider Edge Cases and Data Variations\n\n- Both queries should handle the same edge cases since they are filtering on the same conditions.\n- The use of `EXISTS` vs. `INNER JOIN` could potentially affect performance but not the logical equivalence of results.\n\n### Step 5: Evaluate Aggregations and Calculations\n\n- No aggregations or complex calculations are involved in either query.\n\n### Step 6: Check for Logical Equivalence in Conditional Expressions\n\n- The conditional expressions in both queries are logically equivalent.\n\n### Step 7: Assess Ordering of Results\n\n- Neither query specifies an `ORDER BY` clause, so result order is not a factor in equivalence.\n\n### Step 8: Generate a New Logical Equivalence Rule\n\nBased on the analysis, the two queries are logically equivalent.

INFO:root:prompt: You are an expert SQL engineer with 20+ years of experience. You will be given some SQL equivalence rules conditional on some database schemas. You will then be given a pair of SQL queries, consisting of a gold query and a machine-generated query, and a database schema that defines the context of the queries. 

Your task is to compare the two provided SQL queries on logical equivalence and generate one more equivalence rule in the same format as the provided example equivalence rules.

Please make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please also keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.



Evaluation Criteria:

Logical equivalence - the alignment between the gold SQL query and the machine-generated SQL query. A machine-generated SQL query is logically equivalent to the gold query if these two queries would RETURN THE SAME RESULTS AND IN THE SAME ORDER for ALL POSSIBLE DATABASE INSTANCES that satisfy the provided database schema for these queries. Annotators were asked to penalize machine-generated queries that overlooked edge cases that the gold queries would have caught otherwise.



Evaluation steps:

1. Understand the Database Schema: Identify all tables used in both queries. List all columns referenced, along with their data types and constraints. Determine primary and foreign key relationships. Note any indexes or unique constraints that may affect query execution.
2. Parse and Break Down Each Query: Identify selected columns, functions, and expressions. Note the tables involved and the join conditions. Understand the filtering conditions applied. Identify grouping and aggregate conditions, if any. Determine if result ordering affects equivalence.
3. Compare Query Components: Check if both queries use the same tables and join conditions. Compare filtering conditions in the WHERE clauses. Assess whether the same columns and expressions are selected. Identify if different functions or syntaxes achieve the same result. Look for logical equivalence in expressions and calculations.
4. Consider Edge Cases and Data Variations: Conceptualize sample datasets that include edge cases (e.g., NULL values, zero values, special characters). Analyze how each query handles these edge cases. Ensure that data type differences do not affect the outcome. Verify that constraints (e.g., NOT NULL, UNIQUE) are accounted for.
5. Evaluate Aggregations and Calculations: Confirm that aggregate functions (e.g., SUM, COUNT) are applied identically. Ensure calculations (e.g., subtraction, addition) produce the same results.
6. Check for Logical Equivalence in Conditional Expressions: Compare conditional expressions like IIF, CASE WHEN, and IF. Determine if conditions and returned values are logically the same.
7. Assess Ordering of Results: If ORDER BY clause is present, confirm that both queries order results identically. Recognize that differing order may affect equivalence if result order is significant.
8. Generate a New Logical Equivalence Rule (If Applicable): Create an "Equivalent Queries: <query1>
<query2>
Schema Conditions:<conditions>" statement that defines the equivalence. Use GENERALIZED COLUMN and TABLE NAMES. Specify any necessary conditions based on the database schema. Present the rule clearly, indicating both the equivalence and the conditions under which it holds.



Example Equivalence Rules:

<Rule>
Equivalent Queries:
SELECT c1 from t1 WHERE ...;
SELECT c1 FROM t1 WHERE ...;
Schema Conditions:
None.
</Rule>



# Guidelines:
- Make SURE complete to every step PERFECTLY without ANY Mistakes
- Follow the Rules I Gave you and Remember to AVOID generating repeated equivalence rules in the examples I gave you.
- Be sure to format your response like the example equivalence rules I gave you.
- Put <New Rule></New Rule> around the new equivalence rule that you think of. Do not use other formatting around the equivalent queries.
- Use GENERALIZED COLUMN AND TABLE NAMES in any EQUIVALENCE RULE YOU WRITE. DO NOT USE THE SAME NAMES IN THE PROVIDED QUERY PAIRS!!!!
- If the two queries are not logically equivalent, say <New Rule> Not equivalent </New Rule>.
- If the new equivalence rule is already repeated in the examples listed, say <New Rule> Rule exists </New Rule>.
- The new rule should be be MINIMAL to CLEARLY demonstrate the highlighted semantic difference. Use ellipses to shorten SQL queries where necessary to achieve this.

Take a Deep Breath and Carefully Follow the Rules, Guides and Examples I gave you. I will tip you $2000 if you do EVERYTHING Perfectly.

Your task is to compare the two provided SQL queries on logical equivalence and generate one more equivalence rule in the same format as the provided example equivalence rules.

Please make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please also keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.



Evaluation Criteria:

Logical equivalence - the alignment between the gold SQL query and the machine-generated SQL query. A machine-generated SQL query is logically equivalent to the gold query if these two queries would RETURN THE SAME RESULTS AND IN THE SAME ORDER for ALL POSSIBLE DATABASE INSTANCES that satisfy the provided database schema for these queries.

Evaluation steps:

4. Consider Edge Cases and Data Variations: Conceptualize sample datasets that include edge cases (e.g., NULL values, zero values, special characters). Analyze how each query handles these edge cases. Ensure that data type differences do not affect the outcome. Verify that constraints (e.g., NOT NULL, UNIQUE) are accounted for.
5. Evaluate Aggregations and Calculations: Confirm that aggregate functions (e.g., SUM, COUNT) are applied identically. Ensure calculations (e.g., subtraction, addition) produce the same results.
6. Check for Logical Equivalence in Conditional Expressions: Compare conditional expressions like IIF, CASE WHEN, and IF. Determine if conditions and returned values are logically the same.

INFO:root:prompt: You are an expert SQL engineer with 20+ years of experience. You will be given some SQL equivalence rules conditional on some database schemas. You will then be given a pair of SQL queries, consisting of a gold query and a machine-generated query, and a database schema that defines the context of the queries. 

Your task is to compare the two provided SQL queries on logical equivalence and generate one more equivalence rule in the same format as the provided example equivalence rules.

Please make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please also keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.



Evaluation Criteria:

Logical equivalence - the alignment between the gold SQL query and the machine-generated SQL query. A machine-generated SQL query is logically equivalent to the gold query if these two queries would RETURN THE SAME RESULTS AND IN THE SAME ORDER for ALL POSSIBLE DATABASE INSTANCES that satisfy the provided database schema for these queries. Annotators were asked to penalize machine-generated queries that overlooked edge cases that the gold queries would have caught otherwise.



Evaluation steps:

1. Understand the Database Schema: Identify all tables used in both queries. List all columns referenced, along with their data types and constraints. Determine primary and foreign key relationships. Note any indexes or unique constraints that may affect query execution.
2. Parse and Break Down Each Query: Identify selected columns, functions, and expressions. Note the tables involved and the join conditions. Understand the filtering conditions applied. Identify grouping and aggregate conditions, if any. Determine if result ordering affects equivalence.
3. Compare Query Components: Check if both queries use the same tables and join conditions. Compare filtering conditions in the WHERE clauses. Assess whether the same columns and expressions are selected. Identify if different functions or syntaxes achieve the same result. Look for logical equivalence in expressions and calculations.
4. Consider Edge Cases and Data Variations: Conceptualize sample datasets that include edge cases (e.g., NULL values, zero values, special characters). Analyze how each query handles these edge cases. Ensure that data type differences do not affect the outcome. Verify that constraints (e.g., NOT NULL, UNIQUE) are accounted for.
5. Evaluate Aggregations and Calculations: Confirm that aggregate functions (e.g., SUM, COUNT) are applied identically. Ensure calculations (e.g., subtraction, addition) produce the same results.
6. Check for Logical Equivalence in Conditional Expressions: Compare conditional expressions like IIF, CASE WHEN, and IF. Determine if conditions and returned values are logically the same.
7. Assess Ordering of Results: If ORDER BY clause is present, confirm that both queries order results identically. Recognize that differing order may affect equivalence if result order is significant.
8. Generate a New Logical Equivalence Rule (If Applicable): Create an "Equivalent Queries: <query1>
<query2>
Schema Conditions:<conditions>" statement that defines the equivalence. Use GENERALIZED COLUMN and TABLE NAMES. Specify any necessary conditions based on the database schema. Present the rule clearly, indicating both the equivalence and the conditions under which it holds.



Example Equivalence Rules:

<Rule>
Equivalent Queries:
SELECT c1 from t1 WHERE ...;
SELECT c1 FROM t1 WHERE ...;
Schema Conditions:
None.
</Rule>



# Guidelines:
- Make SURE complete to every step PERFECTLY without ANY Mistakes
- Follow the Rules I Gave you and Remember to AVOID generating repeated equivalence rules in the examples I gave you.
- Be sure to format your response like the example equivalence rules I gave you.
- Put <New Rule></New Rule> around the new equivalence rule that you think of. Do not use other formatting around the equivalent queries.
- Use GENERALIZED COLUMN AND TABLE NAMES in any EQUIVALENCE RULE YOU WRITE. DO NOT USE THE SAME NAMES IN THE PROVIDED QUERY PAIRS!!!!
- If the two queries are not logically equivalent, say <New Rule> Not equivalent </New Rule>.
- If the new equivalence rule is already repeated in the examples listed, say <New Rule> Rule exists </New Rule>.
- The new rule should be be MINIMAL to CLEARLY demonstrate the highlighted semantic difference. Use ellipses to shorten SQL queries where necessary to achieve this.

Take a Deep Breath and Carefully Follow the Rules, Guides and Examples I gave you. I will tip you $2000 if you do EVERYTHING Perfectly.

6. Check for Logical Equivalence in Conditional Expressions: Compare conditional expressions like IIF, CASE WHEN, and IF. Determine if conditions and returned values are logically the same.
7. Assess Ordering of Results: If ORDER BY clause is present, confirm that both queries order results identically. Recognize that differing order may affect equivalence if result order is significant.
8. Generate a New Logical Equivalence Rule (If Applicable): Create an "Equivalent Queries: <query1>
<query2>
Schema Conditions:<conditions>" statement that defines the equivalence. Use GENERALIZED COLUMN and TABLE NAMES. Specify any necessary conditions based on the database schema. Present the rule clearly, indicating both the equivalence and the conditions under which it holds.



Example Equivalence Rules:

<Rule>
Equivalent Queries:
SELECT c1 from t1 WHERE ...;
SELECT c1 FROM t1 WHERE ...;
Schema Conditions:
None.
</Rule>



# Guidelines:
- Make SURE complete to every step PERFECTLY without ANY Mistakes
- Follow the Rules I Gave you and Remember to AVOID generating repeated equivalence rules in the examples I gave you.
- Be sure to format your response like the example equivalence rules I gave you.
- Put <New Rule></New Rule> around the new equivalence rule that you think of. Do not use other formatting around the equivalent queries.
- Use GENERALIZED COLUMN AND TABLE NAMES in any EQUIVALENCE RULE YOU WRITE. DO NOT USE THE SAME NAMES IN THE PROVIDED QUERY PAIRS!!!!
- If the two queries are not logically equivalent, say <New Rule> Not equivalent </New Rule>.
- If the new equivalence rule is already repeated in the examples listed, say <New Rule> Rule exists </New Rule>.
- The new rule should be be MINIMAL to CLEARLY demonstrate the highlighted semantic difference. Use ellipses to shorten SQL queries where necessary to achieve this.

Take a Deep Breath and Carefully Follow the Rules, Guides and Examples I gave you. I will tip you $2000 if you do EVERYTHING Perfectly.

INFO:root:model: gpt-4o
INFO:root:prompt: You are an expert SQL engineer with 20+ years of experience. You will be given some SQL equivalence rules conditional on some database schemas. You will then be given a pair of SQL queries, consisting of a gold query and a machine-generated query, and a database schema that defines the context of the queries. 

Your task is to compare the two provided SQL queries on logical equivalence and generate one more equivalence rule in the same format as the provided example equivalence rules.

Please make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please also keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.



Evaluation Criteria:

Logical equivalence - the alignment between the gold SQL query and the machine-generated SQL query. A machine-generated SQL query is logically equivalent to the gold query if these two queries would RETURN THE SAME RESULTS AND IN THE SAME ORDER for ALL POSSIBLE DATABASE INSTANCES that satisfy the provided database schema for these queries. Annotators were asked to penalize machine-generated queries that overlooked edge cases that the gold queries would have caught otherwise.



Evaluation steps:

1. Understand the Database Schema: Identify all tables used in both queries. List all columns referenced, along with their data types and constraints. Determine primary and foreign key relationships. Note any indexes or unique constraints that may affect query execution.
2. Parse and Break Down Each Query: Identify selected columns, functions, and expressions. Note the tables involved and the join conditions. Understand the filtering conditions applied. Identify grouping and aggregate conditions, if any. Determine if result ordering affects equivalence.
3. Compare Query Components: Check if both queries use the same tables and join conditions. Compare filtering conditions in the WHERE clauses. Assess whether the same columns and expressions are selected. Identify if different functions or syntaxes achieve the same result. Look for logical equivalence in expressions and calculations.
4. Consider Edge Cases and Data Variations: Conceptualize sample datasets that include edge cases (e.g., NULL values, zero values, special characters). Analyze how each query handles these edge cases. Ensure that data type differences do not affect the outcome. Verify that constraints (e.g., NOT NULL, UNIQUE) are accounted for.
5. Evaluate Aggregations and Calculations: Confirm that aggregate functions (e.g., SUM, COUNT) are applied identically. Ensure calculations (e.g., subtraction, addition) produce the same results.
6. Check for Logical Equivalence in Conditional Expressions: Compare conditional expressions like IIF, CASE WHEN, and IF. Determine if conditions and returned values are logically the same.
7. Assess Ordering of Results: If ORDER BY clause is present, confirm that both queries order results identically. Recognize that differing order may affect equivalence if result order is significant.
8. Generate a New Logical Equivalence Rule (If Applicable): Create an "Equivalent Queries: <query1>
<query2>
Schema Conditions:<conditions>" statement that defines the equivalence. Use GENERALIZED COLUMN and TABLE NAMES. Specify any necessary conditions based on the database schema. Present the rule clearly, indicating both the equivalence and the conditions under which it holds.



Example Equivalence Rules:

<Rule>
Equivalent Queries:
SELECT c1 from t1 WHERE ...;
SELECT c1 FROM t1 WHERE ...;
Schema Conditions:
None.
</Rule>



# Guidelines:
- Make SURE complete to every step PERFECTLY without ANY Mistakes

INFO:root:prompt: You are an expert SQL engineer with 20+ years of experience. You will be given some SQL equivalence rules conditional on some database schemas. You will then be given a pair of SQL queries, consisting of a gold query and a machine-generated query, and a database schema that defines the context of the queries. 

Your task is to compare the two provided SQL queries on logical equivalence and generate one more equivalence rule in the same format as the provided example equivalence rules.

Please make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please also keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.



Evaluation Criteria:

Logical equivalence - the alignment between the gold SQL query and the machine-generated SQL query. A machine-generated SQL query is logically equivalent to the gold query if these two queries would RETURN THE SAME RESULTS AND IN THE SAME ORDER for ALL POSSIBLE DATABASE INSTANCES that satisfy the provided database schema for these queries. Annotators were asked to penalize machine-generated queries that overlooked edge cases that the gold queries would have caught otherwise.



Evaluation steps:

1. Understand the Database Schema: Identify all tables used in both queries. List all columns referenced, along with their data types and constraints. Determine primary and foreign key relationships. Note any indexes or unique constraints that may affect query execution.
2. Parse and Break Down Each Query: Identify selected columns, functions, and expressions. Note the tables involved and the join conditions. Understand the filtering conditions applied. Identify grouping and aggregate conditions, if any. Determine if result ordering affects equivalence.
3. Compare Query Components: Check if both queries use the same tables and join conditions. Compare filtering conditions in the WHERE clauses. Assess whether the same columns and expressions are selected. Identify if different functions or syntaxes achieve the same result. Look for logical equivalence in expressions and calculations.
4. Consider Edge Cases and Data Variations: Conceptualize sample datasets that include edge cases (e.g., NULL values, zero values, special characters). Analyze how each query handles these edge cases. Ensure that data type differences do not affect the outcome. Verify that constraints (e.g., NOT NULL, UNIQUE) are accounted for.
5. Evaluate Aggregations and Calculations: Confirm that aggregate functions (e.g., SUM, COUNT) are applied identically. Ensure calculations (e.g., subtraction, addition) produce the same results.
6. Check for Logical Equivalence in Conditional Expressions: Compare conditional expressions like IIF, CASE WHEN, and IF. Determine if conditions and returned values are logically the same.
7. Assess Ordering of Results: If ORDER BY clause is present, confirm that both queries order results identically. Recognize that differing order may affect equivalence if result order is significant.
8. Generate a New Logical Equivalence Rule (If Applicable): Create an "Equivalent Queries: <query1>
<query2>
Schema Conditions:<conditions>" statement that defines the equivalence. Use GENERALIZED COLUMN and TABLE NAMES. Specify any necessary conditions based on the database schema. Present the rule clearly, indicating both the equivalence and the conditions under which it holds.



Example Equivalence Rules:

<Rule>
Equivalent Queries:
SELECT c1 from t1 WHERE ...;
SELECT c1 FROM t1 WHERE ...;
Schema Conditions:
None.
</Rule>



# Guidelines:
- Make SURE complete to every step PERFECTLY without ANY Mistakes
- Follow the Rules I Gave you and Remember to AVOID generating repeated equivalence rules in the examples I gave you.
- Be sure to format your response like the example equivalence rules I gave you.
- Put <New Rule></New Rule> around the new equivalence rule that you think of. Do not use other formatting around the equivalent queries.
- Use GENERALIZED COLUMN AND TABLE NAMES in any EQUIVALENCE RULE YOU WRITE. DO NOT USE THE SAME NAMES IN THE PROVIDED QUERY PAIRS!!!!
- If the two queries are not logically equivalent, say <New Rule> Not equivalent </New Rule>.
- If the new equivalence rule is already repeated in the examples listed, say <New Rule> Rule exists </New Rule>.
- The new rule should be be MINIMAL to CLEARLY demonstrate the highlighted semantic difference. Use ellipses to shorten SQL queries where necessary to achieve this.

Take a Deep Breath and Carefully Follow the Rules, Guides and Examples I gave you. I will tip you $2000 if you do EVERYTHING Perfectly.

INFO:root:prompt: You are an expert SQL engineer with 20+ years of experience. You will be given some SQL equivalence rules conditional on some database schemas. You will then be given a pair of SQL queries, consisting of a gold query and a machine-generated query, and a database schema that defines the context of the queries. 

Your task is to compare the two provided SQL queries on logical equivalence and generate one more equivalence rule in the same format as the provided example equivalence rules.

Please make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please also keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.



Evaluation Criteria:

Logical equivalence - the alignment between the gold SQL query and the machine-generated SQL query. A machine-generated SQL query is logically equivalent to the gold query if these two queries would RETURN THE SAME RESULTS AND IN THE SAME ORDER for ALL POSSIBLE DATABASE INSTANCES that satisfy the provided database schema for these queries. Annotators were asked to penalize machine-generated queries that overlooked edge cases that the gold queries would have caught otherwise.



Evaluation steps:

1. Understand the Database Schema: Identify all tables used in both queries. List all columns referenced, along with their data types and constraints. Determine primary and foreign key relationships. Note any indexes or unique constraints that may affect query execution.
2. Parse and Break Down Each Query: Identify selected columns, functions, and expressions. Note the tables involved and the join conditions. Understand the filtering conditions applied. Identify grouping and aggregate conditions, if any. Determine if result ordering affects equivalence.
3. Compare Query Components: Check if both queries use the same tables and join conditions. Compare filtering conditions in the WHERE clauses. Assess whether the same columns and expressions are selected. Identify if different functions or syntaxes achieve the same result. Look for logical equivalence in expressions and calculations.
4. Consider Edge Cases and Data Variations: Conceptualize sample datasets that include edge cases (e.g., NULL values, zero values, special characters). Analyze how each query handles these edge cases. Ensure that data type differences do not affect the outcome. Verify that constraints (e.g., NOT NULL, UNIQUE) are accounted for.
5. Evaluate Aggregations and Calculations: Confirm that aggregate functions (e.g., SUM, COUNT) are applied identically. Ensure calculations (e.g., subtraction, addition) produce the same results.
6. Check for Logical Equivalence in Conditional Expressions: Compare conditional expressions like IIF, CASE WHEN, and IF. Determine if conditions and returned values are logically the same.
7. Assess Ordering of Results: If ORDER BY clause is present, confirm that both queries order results identically. Recognize that differing order may affect equivalence if result order is significant.
8. Generate a New Logical Equivalence Rule (If Applicable): Create an "Equivalent Queries: <query1>
<query2>
Schema Conditions:<conditions>" statement that defines the equivalence. Use GENERALIZED COLUMN and TABLE NAMES. Specify any necessary conditions based on the database schema. Present the rule clearly, indicating both the equivalence and the conditions under which it holds.



Example Equivalence Rules:

<Rule>
Equivalent Queries:
SELECT c1 from t1 WHERE ...;
SELECT c1 FROM t1 WHERE ...;
Schema Conditions:
None.
</Rule>



# Guidelines:
- Make SURE complete to every step PERFECTLY without ANY Mistakes
- Follow the Rules I Gave you and Remember to AVOID generating repeated equivalence rules in the examples I gave you.
- Be sure to format your response like the example equivalence rules I gave you.
- Put <New Rule></New Rule> around the new equivalence rule that you think of. Do not use other formatting around the equivalent queries.
- Use GENERALIZED COLUMN AND TABLE NAMES in any EQUIVALENCE RULE YOU WRITE. DO NOT USE THE SAME NAMES IN THE PROVIDED QUERY PAIRS!!!!
- If the two queries are not logically equivalent, say <New Rule> Not equivalent </New Rule>.
- If the new equivalence rule is already repeated in the examples listed, say <New Rule> Rule exists </New Rule>.
- The new rule should be be MINIMAL to CLEARLY demonstrate the highlighted semantic difference. Use ellipses to shorten SQL queries where necessary to achieve this.

INFO:root:prompt: You are an expert SQL engineer with 20+ years of experience. You will be given some SQL equivalence rules conditional on some database schemas. You will then be given a pair of SQL queries, consisting of a gold query and a machine-generated query, and a database schema that defines the context of the queries. 

Your task is to compare the two provided SQL queries on logical equivalence and generate one more equivalence rule in the same format as the provided example equivalence rules.

Please make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please also keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.



Evaluation Criteria:

Logical equivalence - the alignment between the gold SQL query and the machine-generated SQL query. A machine-generated SQL query is logically equivalent to the gold query if these two queries would RETURN THE SAME RESULTS AND IN THE SAME ORDER for ALL POSSIBLE DATABASE INSTANCES that satisfy the provided database schema for these queries. Annotators were asked to penalize machine-generated queries that overlooked edge cases that the gold queries would have caught otherwise.



Evaluation steps:

1. Understand the Database Schema: Identify all tables used in both queries. List all columns referenced, along with their data types and constraints. Determine primary and foreign key relationships. Note any indexes or unique constraints that may affect query execution.
2. Parse and Break Down Each Query: Identify selected columns, functions, and expressions. Note the tables involved and the join conditions. Understand the filtering conditions applied. Identify grouping and aggregate conditions, if any. Determine if result ordering affects equivalence.
3. Compare Query Components: Check if both queries use the same tables and join conditions. Compare filtering conditions in the WHERE clauses. Assess whether the same columns and expressions are selected. Identify if different functions or syntaxes achieve the same result. Look for logical equivalence in expressions and calculations.
4. Consider Edge Cases and Data Variations: Conceptualize sample datasets that include edge cases (e.g., NULL values, zero values, special characters). Analyze how each query handles these edge cases. Ensure that data type differences do not affect the outcome. Verify that constraints (e.g., NOT NULL, UNIQUE) are accounted for.
5. Evaluate Aggregations and Calculations: Confirm that aggregate functions (e.g., SUM, COUNT) are applied identically. Ensure calculations (e.g., subtraction, addition) produce the same results.
6. Check for Logical Equivalence in Conditional Expressions: Compare conditional expressions like IIF, CASE WHEN, and IF. Determine if conditions and returned values are logically the same.
7. Assess Ordering of Results: If ORDER BY clause is present, confirm that both queries order results identically. Recognize that differing order may affect equivalence if result order is significant.
8. Generate a New Logical Equivalence Rule (If Applicable): Create an "Equivalent Queries: <query1>
<query2>
Schema Conditions:<conditions>" statement that defines the equivalence. Use GENERALIZED COLUMN and TABLE NAMES. Specify any necessary conditions based on the database schema. Present the rule clearly, indicating both the equivalence and the conditions under which it holds.



Example Equivalence Rules:

<Rule>
Equivalent Queries:
SELECT c1 from t1 WHERE ...;
SELECT c1 FROM t1 WHERE ...;
Schema Conditions:
None.
</Rule>



# Guidelines:
- Make SURE complete to every step PERFECTLY without ANY Mistakes
- Follow the Rules I Gave you and Remember to AVOID generating repeated equivalence rules in the examples I gave you.
- Be sure to format your response like the example equivalence rules I gave you.
- Put <New Rule></New Rule> around the new equivalence rule that you think of. Do not use other formatting around the equivalent queries.
- Use GENERALIZED COLUMN AND TABLE NAMES in any EQUIVALENCE RULE YOU WRITE. DO NOT USE THE SAME NAMES IN THE PROVIDED QUERY PAIRS!!!!
- If the two queries are not logically equivalent, say <New Rule> Not equivalent </New Rule>.
- If the new equivalence rule is already repeated in the examples listed, say <New Rule> Rule exists </New Rule>.
- The new rule should be be MINIMAL to CLEARLY demonstrate the highlighted semantic difference. Use ellipses to shorten SQL queries where necessary to achieve this.

Take a Deep Breath and Carefully Follow the Rules, Guides and Examples I gave you. I will tip you $2000 if you do EVERYTHING Perfectly.

8. Generate a New Logical Equivalence Rule (If Applicable): Create an "Equivalent Queries: <query1>
<query2>
Schema Conditions:<conditions>" statement that defines the equivalence. Use GENERALIZED COLUMN and TABLE NAMES. Specify any necessary conditions based on the database schema. Present the rule clearly, indicating both the equivalence and the conditions under which it holds.



Example Equivalence Rules:

<Rule>
Equivalent Queries:
SELECT c1 from t1 WHERE ...;
SELECT c1 FROM t1 WHERE ...;
Schema Conditions:
None.
</Rule>



# Guidelines:
- Make SURE complete to every step PERFECTLY without ANY Mistakes
- Follow the Rules I Gave you and Remember to AVOID generating repeated equivalence rules in the examples I gave you.
- Be sure to format your response like the example equivalence rules I gave you.
- Put <New Rule></New Rule> around the new equivalence rule that you think of. Do not use other formatting around the equivalent queries.
- Use GENERALIZED COLUMN AND TABLE NAMES in any EQUIVALENCE RULE YOU WRITE. DO NOT USE THE SAME NAMES IN THE PROVIDED QUERY PAIRS!!!!
- If the two queries are not logically equivalent, say <New Rule> Not equivalent </New Rule>.
- If the new equivalence rule is already repeated in the examples listed, say <New Rule> Rule exists </New Rule>.
- The new rule should be be MINIMAL to CLEARLY demonstrate the highlighted semantic difference. Use ellipses to shorten SQL queries where necessary to achieve this.

Take a Deep Breath and Carefully Follow the Rules, Guides and Examples I gave you. I will tip you $2000 if you do EVERYTHING Perfectly.

The `alignment_id` is a foreign key referencing `alignment(id)`.\n  - `alignment`: Contains columns `id` (primary key), `alignment`.\n\n### Step 2: Parse and Break Down Each Query\n\n- **Gold SQL Query:**\n  - **SELECT Clause:** `T1.superhero_name`\n  - **FROM Clause:** `superhero AS T1`\n  - **JOIN Clause:** `INNER JOIN alignment AS T2 ON T1.alignment_id = T2.id`\n  - **WHERE Clause:** `T2.alignment = 'Neutral'`\n\n- **Machine-generated SQL Query:**\n  - **SELECT Clause:** `superhero.superhero_name`\n  - **FROM Clause:** `superhero`\n  - **JOIN Clause:** `INNER JOIN alignment ON superhero.alignment_id = alignment.id`\n  - **WHERE Clause:** `alignment.alignment = 'Neutral'`\n\n### Step 3: Compare Query Components\n\n- Both queries use the same tables (`superhero` and `alignment`) and the same join condition (`superhero.alignment_id = alignment.id`).\n- The filtering condition in the WHERE clause is identical (`alignment.alignment = 'Neutral'`).\n- Both queries select the same column (`superhero_name`).\n- The only difference is the use of table aliases (`T1` and `T2`) in the gold query, which do not affect the logical equivalence.\n\n### Step 4: Consider Edge Cases and Data Variations\n\n- Both queries will handle edge cases like NULL values or missing data in the same way due to identical WHERE clauses and JOIN conditions.\n- Data type differences do not affect the outcome, as the selected column and conditions are the same.\n\n### Step 5: Evaluate Aggregations and Calculations\n\n- There are no aggregations or calculations involved in these queries.\n\n### Step 6: Check for Logical Equivalence in Conditional Expressions\n\n- The conditional expressions in the WHERE clause are identical.\n\n### Step 7: Assess Ordering of Results\n\n- Neither query specifies an ORDER BY clause, so the result order is not guaranteed in either query. This does not affect logical equivalence.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBoth queries are logically equivalent as they would return the same results for all possible database instances that satisfy the provided schema.\n\n### Step 8: Generate a New Logical Equivalence Rule\n\nSince the queries are logically equivalent, we can generate a new rule:\n\n<New Rule>\nEquivalent Queries:\nSELECT T1.c1 FROM t1 AS T1 INNER JOIN t2 AS T2 ON T1.c2 = T2.c3 WHERE T2.c4 = 'value';\nSELECT t1.c1 FROM t1 INNER JOIN t2 ON t1.c2 = t2.c3 WHERE t2.c4 = 'value';\nSchema Conditions:\nNone.\n", role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None, refusal=None))], created=1732078931, model='gpt-4o-2024-08-06', object='chat.completion', system_fingerprint='fp_831e067d82', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=667, prompt_tokens=1460, total_tokens=2127, prompt_tokens_details={'cached_tokens': 0, 'audio_tokens': 0}, completion_tokens_details={'reasoning_tokens': 0, 'audio_tokens': 0, 'accepted_prediction_tokens': 0, 'rejected_prediction_tokens': 0}))

INFO:root:model: gpt-4o
INFO:root:prompt: You are an expert SQL engineer with 20+ years of experience. You will be given some SQL equivalence rules conditional on some database schemas. You will then be given a pair of SQL queries, consisting of a gold query and a machine-generated query, and a database schema that defines the context of the queries. 

Your task is to compare the two provided SQL queries on logical equivalence and generate one more equivalence rule in the same format as the provided example equivalence rules.

Please make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please also keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.



Evaluation Criteria:

Logical equivalence - the alignment between the gold SQL query and the machine-generated SQL query. A machine-generated SQL query is logically equivalent to the gold query if these two queries would RETURN THE SAME RESULTS AND IN THE SAME ORDER for ALL POSSIBLE DATABASE INSTANCES that satisfy the provided database schema for these queries. Annotators were asked to penalize machine-generated queries that overlooked edge cases that the gold queries would have caught otherwise.



Evaluation steps:

1. Understand the Database Schema: Identify all tables used in both queries. List all columns referenced, along with their data types and constraints. Determine primary and foreign key relationships. Note any indexes or unique constraints that may affect query execution.
2. Parse and Break Down Each Query: Identify selected columns, functions, and expressions. Note the tables involved and the join conditions. Understand the filtering conditions applied. Identify grouping and aggregate conditions, if any. Determine if result ordering affects equivalence.
3. Compare Query Components: Check if both queries use the same tables and join conditions. Compare filtering conditions in the WHERE clauses. Assess whether the same columns and expressions are selected. Identify if different functions or syntaxes achieve the same result. Look for logical equivalence in expressions and calculations.
4. Consider Edge Cases and Data Variations: Conceptualize sample datasets that include edge cases (e.g., NULL values, zero values, special characters). Analyze how each query handles these edge cases. Ensure that data type differences do not affect the outcome. Verify that constraints (e.g., NOT NULL, UNIQUE) are accounted for.
5. Evaluate Aggregations and Calculations: Confirm that aggregate functions (e.g., SUM, COUNT) are applied identically. Ensure calculations (e.g., subtraction, addition) produce the same results.
6. Check for Logical Equivalence in Conditional Expressions: Compare conditional expressions like IIF, CASE WHEN, and IF. Determine if conditions and returned values are logically the same.
7. Assess Ordering of Results: If ORDER BY clause is present, confirm that both queries order results identically. Recognize that differing order may affect equivalence if result order is significant.
8. Generate a New Logical Equivalence Rule (If Applicable): Create an "Equivalent Queries: <query1>
<query2>
Schema Conditions:<conditions>" statement that defines the equivalence. Use GENERALIZED COLUMN and TABLE NAMES. Specify any necessary conditions based on the database schema. Present the rule clearly, indicating both the equivalence and the conditions under which it holds.



Example Equivalence Rules:

<Rule>
Equivalent Queries:
SELECT c1 from t1 WHERE ...;
SELECT c1 FROM t1 WHERE ...;
Schema Conditions:
None.
</Rule>



# Guidelines:
- Make SURE complete to every step PERFECTLY without ANY Mistakes

INFO:root:prompt: You are an expert SQL engineer with 20+ years of experience. You will be given some SQL equivalence rules conditional on some database schemas. You will then be given a pair of SQL queries, consisting of a gold query and a machine-generated query, and a database schema that defines the context of the queries. 

Your task is to compare the two provided SQL queries on logical equivalence and generate one more equivalence rule in the same format as the provided example equivalence rules.

Please make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please also keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.



Evaluation Criteria:

Logical equivalence - the alignment between the gold SQL query and the machine-generated SQL query. A machine-generated SQL query is logically equivalent to the gold query if these two queries would RETURN THE SAME RESULTS AND IN THE SAME ORDER for ALL POSSIBLE DATABASE INSTANCES that satisfy the provided database schema for these queries. Annotators were asked to penalize machine-generated queries that overlooked edge cases that the gold queries would have caught otherwise.



Evaluation steps:

1. Understand the Database Schema: Identify all tables used in both queries. List all columns referenced, along with their data types and constraints. Determine primary and foreign key relationships. Note any indexes or unique constraints that may affect query execution.
2. Parse and Break Down Each Query: Identify selected columns, functions, and expressions. Note the tables involved and the join conditions. Understand the filtering conditions applied. Identify grouping and aggregate conditions, if any. Determine if result ordering affects equivalence.
3. Compare Query Components: Check if both queries use the same tables and join conditions. Compare filtering conditions in the WHERE clauses. Assess whether the same columns and expressions are selected. Identify if different functions or syntaxes achieve the same result. Look for logical equivalence in expressions and calculations.
4. Consider Edge Cases and Data Variations: Conceptualize sample datasets that include edge cases (e.g., NULL values, zero values, special characters). Analyze how each query handles these edge cases. Ensure that data type differences do not affect the outcome. Verify that constraints (e.g., NOT NULL, UNIQUE) are accounted for.
5. Evaluate Aggregations and Calculations: Confirm that aggregate functions (e.g., SUM, COUNT) are applied identically. Ensure calculations (e.g., subtraction, addition) produce the same results.
6. Check for Logical Equivalence in Conditional Expressions: Compare conditional expressions like IIF, CASE WHEN, and IF. Determine if conditions and returned values are logically the same.
7. Assess Ordering of Results: If ORDER BY clause is present, confirm that both queries order results identically. Recognize that differing order may affect equivalence if result order is significant.
8. Generate a New Logical Equivalence Rule (If Applicable): Create an "Equivalent Queries: <query1>
<query2>
Schema Conditions:<conditions>" statement that defines the equivalence. Use GENERALIZED COLUMN and TABLE NAMES. Specify any necessary conditions based on the database schema. Present the rule clearly, indicating both the equivalence and the conditions under which it holds.



Example Equivalence Rules:

<Rule>
Equivalent Queries:
SELECT c1 from t1 WHERE ...;
SELECT c1 FROM t1 WHERE ...;
Schema Conditions:
None.
</Rule>



# Guidelines:
- Make SURE complete to every step PERFECTLY without ANY Mistakes
- Follow the Rules I Gave you and Remember to AVOID generating repeated equivalence rules in the examples I gave you.
- Be sure to format your response like the example equivalence rules I gave you.
- Put <New Rule></New Rule> around the new equivalence rule that you think of. Do not use other formatting around the equivalent queries.
- Use GENERALIZED COLUMN AND TABLE NAMES in any EQUIVALENCE RULE YOU WRITE. DO NOT USE THE SAME NAMES IN THE PROVIDED QUERY PAIRS!!!!
- If the two queries are not logically equivalent, say <New Rule> Not equivalent </New Rule>.
- If the new equivalence rule is already repeated in the examples listed, say <New Rule> Rule exists </New Rule>.
- The new rule should be be MINIMAL to CLEARLY demonstrate the highlighted semantic difference. Use ellipses to shorten SQL queries where necessary to achieve this.

Understand the Database Schema:\n- **Table:** `superhero`\n- **Columns:**\n  - `id`: INTEGER, Primary Key\n  - `superhero_name`: TEXT\n  - `full_name`: TEXT\n  - `gender_id`: INTEGER, Foreign Key\n  - `eye_colour_id`: INTEGER, Foreign Key\n  - `hair_colour_id`: INTEGER, Foreign Key\n  - `skin_colour_id`: INTEGER, Foreign Key\n  - `race_id`: INTEGER, Foreign Key\n  - `publisher_id`: INTEGER, Foreign Key\n  - `alignment_id`: INTEGER, Foreign Key\n  - `height_cm`: INTEGER\n  - `weight_kg`: INTEGER\n\n### 2. Parse and Break Down Each Query:\n- **Gold SQL Query:**\n  - **Subquery 1:** Fetches `weight_kg` for `full_name` 'Emil Blonsky'.\n  - **Subquery 2:** Fetches `weight_kg` for `full_name` 'Charles Chandler'.\n  - **Operation:** Subtracts the result of Subquery 2 from Subquery 1 and labels the result as `CALCULATE`.\n\n- **Machine-generated SQL Query:**\n  - **Main Query:** Fetches `weight_kg` for `full_name` 'Emil Blonsky'.\n  - **Subquery:** Fetches `weight_kg` for `full_name` 'Charles Chandler'.\n  - **Operation:** Subtracts the result of the Subquery from the `weight_kg` fetched in the Main Query.\n\n### 3. Compare Query Components:\n- Both queries use the `superhero` table and reference the `weight_kg` and `full_name` columns.\n- Both queries aim to perform the same subtraction operation between the weights of 'Emil Blonsky' and 'Charles Chandler'.\n\n### 4. Consider Edge Cases and Data Variations:\n- Both queries assume that there is exactly one entry for each `full_name` in the `superhero` table.\n- If there are multiple entries or if any of the entries return `NULL`, the queries could behave differently.\n- The use of `LIKE` in the Gold SQL Query allows for pattern matching, while `=` in the Machine-generated SQL Query requires an exact match. However, since the strings are fully specified, they are equivalent in this context.\n\n### 5. Evaluate Aggregations and Calculations:\n- Both queries perform the same subtraction operation.\n\n### 6. Check for Logical Equivalence in Conditional Expressions:\n- The use of `LIKE` versus `=` doesn't affect the outcome given the specific strings.\n\n### 7. Assess Ordering of Results:\n- There is no `ORDER BY` clause in either query, so result ordering is not a factor.\n\n### Conclusion:\nBoth queries are logically equivalent under the given schema and context.\n\n### 8.

INFO:root:prompt: You are an expert SQL engineer with 20+ years of experience. You will be given some SQL equivalence rules conditional on some database schemas. You will then be given a pair of SQL queries, consisting of a gold query and a machine-generated query, and a database schema that defines the context of the queries. 

Your task is to compare the two provided SQL queries on logical equivalence and generate one more equivalence rule in the same format as the provided example equivalence rules.

Please make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please also keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.



Evaluation Criteria:

Logical equivalence - the alignment between the gold SQL query and the machine-generated SQL query. A machine-generated SQL query is logically equivalent to the gold query if these two queries would RETURN THE SAME RESULTS AND IN THE SAME ORDER for ALL POSSIBLE DATABASE INSTANCES that satisfy the provided database schema for these queries. Annotators were asked to penalize machine-generated queries that overlooked edge cases that the gold queries would have caught otherwise.



Evaluation steps:

1. Understand the Database Schema: Identify all tables used in both queries. List all columns referenced, along with their data types and constraints. Determine primary and foreign key relationships. Note any indexes or unique constraints that may affect query execution.
2. Parse and Break Down Each Query: Identify selected columns, functions, and expressions. Note the tables involved and the join conditions. Understand the filtering conditions applied. Identify grouping and aggregate conditions, if any. Determine if result ordering affects equivalence.
3. Compare Query Components: Check if both queries use the same tables and join conditions. Compare filtering conditions in the WHERE clauses. Assess whether the same columns and expressions are selected. Identify if different functions or syntaxes achieve the same result. Look for logical equivalence in expressions and calculations.
4. Consider Edge Cases and Data Variations: Conceptualize sample datasets that include edge cases (e.g., NULL values, zero values, special characters). Analyze how each query handles these edge cases. Ensure that data type differences do not affect the outcome. Verify that constraints (e.g., NOT NULL, UNIQUE) are accounted for.
5. Evaluate Aggregations and Calculations: Confirm that aggregate functions (e.g., SUM, COUNT) are applied identically. Ensure calculations (e.g., subtraction, addition) produce the same results.
6. Check for Logical Equivalence in Conditional Expressions: Compare conditional expressions like IIF, CASE WHEN, and IF. Determine if conditions and returned values are logically the same.
7. Assess Ordering of Results: If ORDER BY clause is present, confirm that both queries order results identically. Recognize that differing order may affect equivalence if result order is significant.
8. Generate a New Logical Equivalence Rule (If Applicable): Create an "Equivalent Queries: <query1>
<query2>
Schema Conditions:<conditions>" statement that defines the equivalence. Use GENERALIZED COLUMN and TABLE NAMES. Specify any necessary conditions based on the database schema. Present the rule clearly, indicating both the equivalence and the conditions under which it holds.



Example Equivalence Rules:

<Rule>
Equivalent Queries:
SELECT c1 from t1 WHERE ...;
SELECT c1 FROM t1 WHERE ...;
Schema Conditions:
None.
</Rule>



# Guidelines:
- Make SURE complete to every step PERFECTLY without ANY Mistakes
- Follow the Rules I Gave you and Remember to AVOID generating repeated equivalence rules in the examples I gave you.
- Be sure to format your response like the example equivalence rules I gave you.
- Put <New Rule></New Rule> around the new equivalence rule that you think of. Do not use other formatting around the equivalent queries.
- Use GENERALIZED COLUMN AND TABLE NAMES in any EQUIVALENCE RULE YOU WRITE. DO NOT USE THE SAME NAMES IN THE PROVIDED QUERY PAIRS!!!!
- If the two queries are not logically equivalent, say <New Rule> Not equivalent </New Rule>.
- If the new equivalence rule is already repeated in the examples listed, say <New Rule> Rule exists </New Rule>.
- The new rule should be be MINIMAL to CLEARLY demonstrate the highlighted semantic difference. Use ellipses to shorten SQL queries where necessary to achieve this.

INFO:root:prompt: You are an expert SQL engineer with 20+ years of experience. You will be given some SQL equivalence rules conditional on some database schemas. You will then be given a pair of SQL queries, consisting of a gold query and a machine-generated query, and a database schema that defines the context of the queries. 

Your task is to compare the two provided SQL queries on logical equivalence and generate one more equivalence rule in the same format as the provided example equivalence rules.

Please make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please also keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.



Evaluation Criteria:

Logical equivalence - the alignment between the gold SQL query and the machine-generated SQL query. A machine-generated SQL query is logically equivalent to the gold query if these two queries would RETURN THE SAME RESULTS AND IN THE SAME ORDER for ALL POSSIBLE DATABASE INSTANCES that satisfy the provided database schema for these queries. Annotators were asked to penalize machine-generated queries that overlooked edge cases that the gold queries would have caught otherwise.



Evaluation steps:

1. Understand the Database Schema: Identify all tables used in both queries. List all columns referenced, along with their data types and constraints. Determine primary and foreign key relationships. Note any indexes or unique constraints that may affect query execution.
2. Parse and Break Down Each Query: Identify selected columns, functions, and expressions. Note the tables involved and the join conditions. Understand the filtering conditions applied. Identify grouping and aggregate conditions, if any. Determine if result ordering affects equivalence.
3. Compare Query Components: Check if both queries use the same tables and join conditions. Compare filtering conditions in the WHERE clauses. Assess whether the same columns and expressions are selected. Identify if different functions or syntaxes achieve the same result. Look for logical equivalence in expressions and calculations.
4. Consider Edge Cases and Data Variations: Conceptualize sample datasets that include edge cases (e.g., NULL values, zero values, special characters). Analyze how each query handles these edge cases. Ensure that data type differences do not affect the outcome. Verify that constraints (e.g., NOT NULL, UNIQUE) are accounted for.
5. Evaluate Aggregations and Calculations: Confirm that aggregate functions (e.g., SUM, COUNT) are applied identically. Ensure calculations (e.g., subtraction, addition) produce the same results.
6. Check for Logical Equivalence in Conditional Expressions: Compare conditional expressions like IIF, CASE WHEN, and IF. Determine if conditions and returned values are logically the same.
7. Assess Ordering of Results: If ORDER BY clause is present, confirm that both queries order results identically. Recognize that differing order may affect equivalence if result order is significant.
8. Generate a New Logical Equivalence Rule (If Applicable): Create an "Equivalent Queries: <query1>
<query2>
Schema Conditions:<conditions>" statement that defines the equivalence. Use GENERALIZED COLUMN and TABLE NAMES. Specify any necessary conditions based on the database schema. Present the rule clearly, indicating both the equivalence and the conditions under which it holds.



Example Equivalence Rules:

<Rule>
Equivalent Queries:
SELECT c1 from t1 WHERE ...;
SELECT c1 FROM t1 WHERE ...;
Schema Conditions:
None.
</Rule>



# Guidelines:
- Make SURE complete to every step PERFECTLY without ANY Mistakes
- Follow the Rules I Gave you and Remember to AVOID generating repeated equivalence rules in the examples I gave you.
- Be sure to format your response like the example equivalence rules I gave you.
- Put <New Rule></New Rule> around the new equivalence rule that you think of. Do not use other formatting around the equivalent queries.
- Use GENERALIZED COLUMN AND TABLE NAMES in any EQUIVALENCE RULE YOU WRITE. DO NOT USE THE SAME NAMES IN THE PROVIDED QUERY PAIRS!!!!
- If the two queries are not logically equivalent, say <New Rule> Not equivalent </New Rule>.
- If the new equivalence rule is already repeated in the examples listed, say <New Rule> Rule exists </New Rule>.
- The new rule should be be MINIMAL to CLEARLY demonstrate the highlighted semantic difference. Use ellipses to shorten SQL queries where necessary to achieve this.

Take a Deep Breath and Carefully Follow the Rules, Guides and Examples I gave you. I will tip you $2000 if you do EVERYTHING Perfectly.

1. Understand the Database Schema: Identify all tables used in both queries. List all columns referenced, along with their data types and constraints. Determine primary and foreign key relationships. Note any indexes or unique constraints that may affect query execution.
2. Parse and Break Down Each Query: Identify selected columns, functions, and expressions. Note the tables involved and the join conditions. Understand the filtering conditions applied. Identify grouping and aggregate conditions, if any. Determine if result ordering affects equivalence.
3. Compare Query Components: Check if both queries use the same tables and join conditions. Compare filtering conditions in the WHERE clauses. Assess whether the same columns and expressions are selected. Identify if different functions or syntaxes achieve the same result. Look for logical equivalence in expressions and calculations.
4. Consider Edge Cases and Data Variations: Conceptualize sample datasets that include edge cases (e.g., NULL values, zero values, special characters). Analyze how each query handles these edge cases. Ensure that data type differences do not affect the outcome. Verify that constraints (e.g., NOT NULL, UNIQUE) are accounted for.
5. Evaluate Aggregations and Calculations: Confirm that aggregate functions (e.g., SUM, COUNT) are applied identically. Ensure calculations (e.g., subtraction, addition) produce the same results.
6. Check for Logical Equivalence in Conditional Expressions: Compare conditional expressions like IIF, CASE WHEN, and IF. Determine if conditions and returned values are logically the same.
7. Assess Ordering of Results: If ORDER BY clause is present, confirm that both queries order results identically. Recognize that differing order may affect equivalence if result order is significant.
8. Generate a New Logical Equivalence Rule (If Applicable): Create an "Equivalent Queries: <query1>
<query2>
Schema Conditions:<conditions>" statement that defines the equivalence. Use GENERALIZED COLUMN and TABLE NAMES. Specify any necessary conditions based on the database schema. Present the rule clearly, indicating both the equivalence and the conditions under which it holds.



Example Equivalence Rules:

<Rule>
Equivalent Queries:
SELECT c1 from t1 WHERE ...;
SELECT c1 FROM t1 WHERE ...;
Schema Conditions:
None.
</Rule>



# Guidelines:
- Make SURE complete to every step PERFECTLY without ANY Mistakes
- Follow the Rules I Gave you and Remember to AVOID generating repeated equivalence rules in the examples I gave you.
- Be sure to format your response like the example equivalence rules I gave you.
- Put <New Rule></New Rule> around the new equivalence rule that you think of. Do not use other formatting around the equivalent queries.
- Use GENERALIZED COLUMN AND TABLE NAMES in any EQUIVALENCE RULE YOU WRITE. DO NOT USE THE SAME NAMES IN THE PROVIDED QUERY PAIRS!!!!
- If the two queries are not logically equivalent, say <New Rule> Not equivalent </New Rule>.
- If the new equivalence rule is already repeated in the examples listed, say <New Rule> Rule exists </New Rule>.
- The new rule should be be MINIMAL to CLEARLY demonstrate the highlighted semantic difference. Use ellipses to shorten SQL queries where necessary to achieve this.

Take a Deep Breath and Carefully Follow the Rules, Guides and Examples I gave you. I will tip you $2000 if you do EVERYTHING Perfectly.

INFO:root:prompt: You are an expert SQL engineer with 20+ years of experience. You will be given some SQL equivalence rules conditional on some database schemas. You will then be given a pair of SQL queries, consisting of a gold query and a machine-generated query, and a database schema that defines the context of the queries. 

Your task is to compare the two provided SQL queries on logical equivalence and generate one more equivalence rule in the same format as the provided example equivalence rules.

Please make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please also keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.



Evaluation Criteria:

Logical equivalence - the alignment between the gold SQL query and the machine-generated SQL query. A machine-generated SQL query is logically equivalent to the gold query if these two queries would RETURN THE SAME RESULTS AND IN THE SAME ORDER for ALL POSSIBLE DATABASE INSTANCES that satisfy the provided database schema for these queries. Annotators were asked to penalize machine-generated queries that overlooked edge cases that the gold queries would have caught otherwise.



Evaluation steps:

1. Understand the Database Schema: Identify all tables used in both queries. List all columns referenced, along with their data types and constraints. Determine primary and foreign key relationships. Note any indexes or unique constraints that may affect query execution.
2. Parse and Break Down Each Query: Identify selected columns, functions, and expressions. Note the tables involved and the join conditions. Understand the filtering conditions applied. Identify grouping and aggregate conditions, if any. Determine if result ordering affects equivalence.
3. Compare Query Components: Check if both queries use the same tables and join conditions. Compare filtering conditions in the WHERE clauses. Assess whether the same columns and expressions are selected. Identify if different functions or syntaxes achieve the same result. Look for logical equivalence in expressions and calculations.
4. Consider Edge Cases and Data Variations: Conceptualize sample datasets that include edge cases (e.g., NULL values, zero values, special characters). Analyze how each query handles these edge cases. Ensure that data type differences do not affect the outcome. Verify that constraints (e.g., NOT NULL, UNIQUE) are accounted for.
5. Evaluate Aggregations and Calculations: Confirm that aggregate functions (e.g., SUM, COUNT) are applied identically. Ensure calculations (e.g., subtraction, addition) produce the same results.
6. Check for Logical Equivalence in Conditional Expressions: Compare conditional expressions like IIF, CASE WHEN, and IF. Determine if conditions and returned values are logically the same.
7. Assess Ordering of Results: If ORDER BY clause is present, confirm that both queries order results identically. Recognize that differing order may affect equivalence if result order is significant.
8. Generate a New Logical Equivalence Rule (If Applicable): Create an "Equivalent Queries: <query1>
<query2>
Schema Conditions:<conditions>" statement that defines the equivalence. Use GENERALIZED COLUMN and TABLE NAMES. Specify any necessary conditions based on the database schema. Present the rule clearly, indicating both the equivalence and the conditions under which it holds.

INFO:root:prompt: You are an expert SQL engineer with 20+ years of experience. You will be given some SQL equivalence rules conditional on some database schemas. You will then be given a pair of SQL queries, consisting of a gold query and a machine-generated query, and a database schema that defines the context of the queries. 

Your task is to compare the two provided SQL queries on logical equivalence and generate one more equivalence rule in the same format as the provided example equivalence rules.

Please make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please also keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.



Evaluation Criteria:

Logical equivalence - the alignment between the gold SQL query and the machine-generated SQL query. A machine-generated SQL query is logically equivalent to the gold query if these two queries would RETURN THE SAME RESULTS AND IN THE SAME ORDER for ALL POSSIBLE DATABASE INSTANCES that satisfy the provided database schema for these queries. Annotators were asked to penalize machine-generated queries that overlooked edge cases that the gold queries would have caught otherwise.



Evaluation steps:

1. Understand the Database Schema: Identify all tables used in both queries. List all columns referenced, along with their data types and constraints. Determine primary and foreign key relationships. Note any indexes or unique constraints that may affect query execution.
2. Parse and Break Down Each Query: Identify selected columns, functions, and expressions. Note the tables involved and the join conditions. Understand the filtering conditions applied. Identify grouping and aggregate conditions, if any. Determine if result ordering affects equivalence.
3. Compare Query Components: Check if both queries use the same tables and join conditions. Compare filtering conditions in the WHERE clauses. Assess whether the same columns and expressions are selected. Identify if different functions or syntaxes achieve the same result. Look for logical equivalence in expressions and calculations.
4. Consider Edge Cases and Data Variations: Conceptualize sample datasets that include edge cases (e.g., NULL values, zero values, special characters). Analyze how each query handles these edge cases. Ensure that data type differences do not affect the outcome. Verify that constraints (e.g., NOT NULL, UNIQUE) are accounted for.
5. Evaluate Aggregations and Calculations: Confirm that aggregate functions (e.g., SUM, COUNT) are applied identically. Ensure calculations (e.g., subtraction, addition) produce the same results.
6. Check for Logical Equivalence in Conditional Expressions: Compare conditional expressions like IIF, CASE WHEN, and IF. Determine if conditions and returned values are logically the same.
7. Assess Ordering of Results: If ORDER BY clause is present, confirm that both queries order results identically. Recognize that differing order may affect equivalence if result order is significant.
8. Generate a New Logical Equivalence Rule (If Applicable): Create an "Equivalent Queries: <query1>
<query2>
Schema Conditions:<conditions>" statement that defines the equivalence. Use GENERALIZED COLUMN and TABLE NAMES. Specify any necessary conditions based on the database schema. Present the rule clearly, indicating both the equivalence and the conditions under which it holds.



Example Equivalence Rules:

<Rule>
Equivalent Queries:
SELECT c1 from t1 WHERE ...;
SELECT c1 FROM t1 WHERE ...;
Schema Conditions:
None.
</Rule>



# Guidelines:
- Make SURE complete to every step PERFECTLY without ANY Mistakes
- Follow the Rules I Gave you and Remember to AVOID generating repeated equivalence rules in the examples I gave you.
- Be sure to format your response like the example equivalence rules I gave you.
- Put <New Rule></New Rule> around the new equivalence rule that you think of. Do not use other formatting around the equivalent queries.
- Use GENERALIZED COLUMN AND TABLE NAMES in any EQUIVALENCE RULE YOU WRITE. DO NOT USE THE SAME NAMES IN THE PROVIDED QUERY PAIRS!!!!
- If the two queries are not logically equivalent, say <New Rule> Not equivalent </New Rule>.
- If the new equivalence rule is already repeated in the examples listed, say <New Rule> Rule exists </New Rule>.
- The new rule should be be MINIMAL to CLEARLY demonstrate the highlighted semantic difference. Use ellipses to shorten SQL queries where necessary to achieve this.

INFO:root:prompt: You are an expert SQL engineer with 20+ years of experience. You will be given some SQL equivalence rules conditional on some database schemas. You will then be given a pair of SQL queries, consisting of a gold query and a machine-generated query, and a database schema that defines the context of the queries. 

Your task is to compare the two provided SQL queries on logical equivalence and generate one more equivalence rule in the same format as the provided example equivalence rules.

Please make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please also keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.



Evaluation Criteria:

Logical equivalence - the alignment between the gold SQL query and the machine-generated SQL query. A machine-generated SQL query is logically equivalent to the gold query if these two queries would RETURN THE SAME RESULTS AND IN THE SAME ORDER for ALL POSSIBLE DATABASE INSTANCES that satisfy the provided database schema for these queries. Annotators were asked to penalize machine-generated queries that overlooked edge cases that the gold queries would have caught otherwise.



Evaluation steps:

1. Understand the Database Schema: Identify all tables used in both queries. List all columns referenced, along with their data types and constraints. Determine primary and foreign key relationships. Note any indexes or unique constraints that may affect query execution.
2. Parse and Break Down Each Query: Identify selected columns, functions, and expressions. Note the tables involved and the join conditions. Understand the filtering conditions applied. Identify grouping and aggregate conditions, if any. Determine if result ordering affects equivalence.
3. Compare Query Components: Check if both queries use the same tables and join conditions. Compare filtering conditions in the WHERE clauses. Assess whether the same columns and expressions are selected. Identify if different functions or syntaxes achieve the same result. Look for logical equivalence in expressions and calculations.
4. Consider Edge Cases and Data Variations: Conceptualize sample datasets that include edge cases (e.g., NULL values, zero values, special characters). Analyze how each query handles these edge cases. Ensure that data type differences do not affect the outcome. Verify that constraints (e.g., NOT NULL, UNIQUE) are accounted for.
5. Evaluate Aggregations and Calculations: Confirm that aggregate functions (e.g., SUM, COUNT) are applied identically. Ensure calculations (e.g., subtraction, addition) produce the same results.
6. Check for Logical Equivalence in Conditional Expressions: Compare conditional expressions like IIF, CASE WHEN, and IF. Determine if conditions and returned values are logically the same.
7. Assess Ordering of Results: If ORDER BY clause is present, confirm that both queries order results identically. Recognize that differing order may affect equivalence if result order is significant.
8. Generate a New Logical Equivalence Rule (If Applicable): Create an "Equivalent Queries: <query1>
<query2>
Schema Conditions:<conditions>" statement that defines the equivalence. Use GENERALIZED COLUMN and TABLE NAMES. Specify any necessary conditions based on the database schema. Present the rule clearly, indicating both the equivalence and the conditions under which it holds.



Example Equivalence Rules:

<Rule>
Equivalent Queries:
SELECT c1 from t1 WHERE ...;
SELECT c1 FROM t1 WHERE ...;
Schema Conditions:
None.
</Rule>



# Guidelines:
- Make SURE complete to every step PERFECTLY without ANY Mistakes
- Follow the Rules I Gave you and Remember to AVOID generating repeated equivalence rules in the examples I gave you.
- Be sure to format your response like the example equivalence rules I gave you.
- Put <New Rule></New Rule> around the new equivalence rule that you think of. Do not use other formatting around the equivalent queries.
- Use GENERALIZED COLUMN AND TABLE NAMES in any EQUIVALENCE RULE YOU WRITE. DO NOT USE THE SAME NAMES IN THE PROVIDED QUERY PAIRS!!!!
- If the two queries are not logically equivalent, say <New Rule> Not equivalent </New Rule>.
- If the new equivalence rule is already repeated in the examples listed, say <New Rule> Rule exists </New Rule>.
- The new rule should be be MINIMAL to CLEARLY demonstrate the highlighted semantic difference. Use ellipses to shorten SQL queries where necessary to achieve this.

INFO:root:model: gpt-4o
INFO:root:prompt: You are an expert SQL engineer with 20+ years of experience. You will be given some SQL equivalence rules conditional on some database schemas. You will then be given a pair of SQL queries, consisting of a gold query and a machine-generated query, and a database schema that defines the context of the queries. 

Your task is to compare the two provided SQL queries on logical equivalence and generate one more equivalence rule in the same format as the provided example equivalence rules.

Please make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please also keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.



Evaluation Criteria:

Logical equivalence - the alignment between the gold SQL query and the machine-generated SQL query. A machine-generated SQL query is logically equivalent to the gold query if these two queries would RETURN THE SAME RESULTS AND IN THE SAME ORDER for ALL POSSIBLE DATABASE INSTANCES that satisfy the provided database schema for these queries. Annotators were asked to penalize machine-generated queries that overlooked edge cases that the gold queries would have caught otherwise.



Evaluation steps:

1. Understand the Database Schema: Identify all tables used in both queries. List all columns referenced, along with their data types and constraints. Determine primary and foreign key relationships. Note any indexes or unique constraints that may affect query execution.
2. Parse and Break Down Each Query: Identify selected columns, functions, and expressions. Note the tables involved and the join conditions. Understand the filtering conditions applied. Identify grouping and aggregate conditions, if any. Determine if result ordering affects equivalence.
3. Compare Query Components: Check if both queries use the same tables and join conditions. Compare filtering conditions in the WHERE clauses. Assess whether the same columns and expressions are selected. Identify if different functions or syntaxes achieve the same result. Look for logical equivalence in expressions and calculations.
4. Consider Edge Cases and Data Variations: Conceptualize sample datasets that include edge cases (e.g., NULL values, zero values, special characters). Analyze how each query handles these edge cases. Ensure that data type differences do not affect the outcome. Verify that constraints (e.g., NOT NULL, UNIQUE) are accounted for.
5. Evaluate Aggregations and Calculations: Confirm that aggregate functions (e.g., SUM, COUNT) are applied identically. Ensure calculations (e.g., subtraction, addition) produce the same results.
6. Check for Logical Equivalence in Conditional Expressions: Compare conditional expressions like IIF, CASE WHEN, and IF. Determine if conditions and returned values are logically the same.
7. Assess Ordering of Results: If ORDER BY clause is present, confirm that both queries order results identically. Recognize that differing order may affect equivalence if result order is significant.
8. Generate a New Logical Equivalence Rule (If Applicable): Create an "Equivalent Queries: <query1>
<query2>
Schema Conditions:<conditions>" statement that defines the equivalence. Use GENERALIZED COLUMN and TABLE NAMES. Specify any necessary conditions based on the database schema. Present the rule clearly, indicating both the equivalence and the conditions under which it holds.



Example Equivalence Rules:

<Rule>
Equivalent Queries:
SELECT c1 from t1 WHERE ...;
SELECT c1 FROM t1 WHERE ...;
Schema Conditions:
None.
</Rule>



# Guidelines:
- Make SURE complete to every step PERFECTLY without ANY Mistakes
- Follow the Rules I Gave you and Remember to AVOID generating repeated equivalence rules in the examples I gave you.
- Be sure to format your response like the example equivalence rules I gave you.
- Put <New Rule></New Rule> around the new equivalence rule that you think of. Do not use other formatting around the equivalent queries.
- Use GENERALIZED COLUMN AND TABLE NAMES in any EQUIVALENCE RULE YOU WRITE. DO NOT USE THE SAME NAMES IN THE PROVIDED QUERY PAIRS!!!!
- If the two queries are not logically equivalent, say <New Rule> Not equivalent </New Rule>.
- If the new equivalence rule is already repeated in the examples listed, say <New Rule> Rule exists </New Rule>.
- The new rule should be be MINIMAL to CLEARLY demonstrate the highlighted semantic difference. Use ellipses to shorten SQL queries where necessary to achieve this.

Take a Deep Breath and Carefully Follow the Rules, Guides and Examples I gave you. I will tip you $2000 if you do EVERYTHING Perfectly.

The difference in case for column names and function names does not affect the result due to SQL's case insensitivity.\n\n<New Rule>\nEquivalent Queries:\nSELECT c1 FROM t1 WHERE STRFTIME('%Y', c2) = 'yyyy';\nSELECT c1 FROM t1 WHERE strftime('%Y', c2) = 'yyyy';\nSchema Conditions:\nNone.\n", role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None, refusal=None))], created=1732079335, model='gpt-4o-2024-08-06', object='chat.completion', system_fingerprint='fp_831e067d82', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=610, prompt_tokens=1896, total_tokens=2506, prompt_tokens_details={'cached_tokens': 0, 'audio_tokens': 0}, completion_tokens_details={'reasoning_tokens': 0, 'audio_tokens': 0, 'accepted_prediction_tokens': 0, 'rejected_prediction_tokens': 0}))

INFO:root:model: gpt-4o
INFO:root:prompt: You are an expert SQL engineer with 20+ years of experience. You will be given some SQL equivalence rules conditional on some database schemas. You will then be given a pair of SQL queries, consisting of a gold query and a machine-generated query, and a database schema that defines the context of the queries. 

Your task is to compare the two provided SQL queries on logical equivalence and generate one more equivalence rule in the same format as the provided example equivalence rules.

Please make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please also keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.



Evaluation Criteria:

Logical equivalence - the alignment between the gold SQL query and the machine-generated SQL query. A machine-generated SQL query is logically equivalent to the gold query if these two queries would RETURN THE SAME RESULTS AND IN THE SAME ORDER for ALL POSSIBLE DATABASE INSTANCES that satisfy the provided database schema for these queries. Annotators were asked to penalize machine-generated queries that overlooked edge cases that the gold queries would have caught otherwise.



Evaluation steps:

1. Understand the Database Schema: Identify all tables used in both queries. List all columns referenced, along with their data types and constraints. Determine primary and foreign key relationships. Note any indexes or unique constraints that may affect query execution.
2. Parse and Break Down Each Query: Identify selected columns, functions, and expressions. Note the tables involved and the join conditions. Understand the filtering conditions applied. Identify grouping and aggregate conditions, if any. Determine if result ordering affects equivalence.
3. Compare Query Components: Check if both queries use the same tables and join conditions. Compare filtering conditions in the WHERE clauses. Assess whether the same columns and expressions are selected. Identify if different functions or syntaxes achieve the same result. Look for logical equivalence in expressions and calculations.
4. Consider Edge Cases and Data Variations: Conceptualize sample datasets that include edge cases (e.g., NULL values, zero values, special characters). Analyze how each query handles these edge cases. Ensure that data type differences do not affect the outcome. Verify that constraints (e.g., NOT NULL, UNIQUE) are accounted for.
5. Evaluate Aggregations and Calculations: Confirm that aggregate functions (e.g., SUM, COUNT) are applied identically. Ensure calculations (e.g., subtraction, addition) produce the same results.
6. Check for Logical Equivalence in Conditional Expressions: Compare conditional expressions like IIF, CASE WHEN, and IF. Determine if conditions and returned values are logically the same.
7. Assess Ordering of Results: If ORDER BY clause is present, confirm that both queries order results identically. Recognize that differing order may affect equivalence if result order is significant.
8. Generate a New Logical Equivalence Rule (If Applicable): Create an "Equivalent Queries: <query1>
<query2>
Schema Conditions:<conditions>" statement that defines the equivalence. Use GENERALIZED COLUMN and TABLE NAMES. Specify any necessary conditions based on the database schema. Present the rule clearly, indicating both the equivalence and the conditions under which it holds.



Example Equivalence Rules:

<Rule>
Equivalent Queries:
SELECT c1 from t1 WHERE ...;
SELECT c1 FROM t1 WHERE ...;
Schema Conditions:
None.
</Rule>



# Guidelines:
- Make SURE complete to every step PERFECTLY without ANY Mistakes
- Follow the Rules I Gave you and Remember to AVOID generating repeated equivalence rules in the examples I gave you.
- Be sure to format your response like the example equivalence rules I gave you.
- Put <New Rule></New Rule> around the new equivalence rule that you think of. Do not use other formatting around the equivalent queries.
- Use GENERALIZED COLUMN AND TABLE NAMES in any EQUIVALENCE RULE YOU WRITE. DO NOT USE THE SAME NAMES IN THE PROVIDED QUERY PAIRS!!!!
- If the two queries are not logically equivalent, say <New Rule> Not equivalent </New Rule>.
- If the new equivalence rule is already repeated in the examples listed, say <New Rule> Rule exists </New Rule>.
- The new rule should be be MINIMAL to CLEARLY demonstrate the highlighted semantic difference. Use ellipses to shorten SQL queries where necessary to achieve this.

Take a Deep Breath and Carefully Follow the Rules, Guides and Examples I gave you. I will tip you $2000 if you do EVERYTHING Perfectly.

INFO:root:model: gpt-4o
INFO:root:prompt: You are an expert SQL engineer with 20+ years of experience. You will be given some SQL equivalence rules conditional on some database schemas. You will then be given a pair of SQL queries, consisting of a gold query and a machine-generated query, and a database schema that defines the context of the queries. 

Your task is to compare the two provided SQL queries on logical equivalence and generate one more equivalence rule in the same format as the provided example equivalence rules.

Please make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please also keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.



Evaluation Criteria:

Logical equivalence - the alignment between the gold SQL query and the machine-generated SQL query. A machine-generated SQL query is logically equivalent to the gold query if these two queries would RETURN THE SAME RESULTS AND IN THE SAME ORDER for ALL POSSIBLE DATABASE INSTANCES that satisfy the provided database schema for these queries. Annotators were asked to penalize machine-generated queries that overlooked edge cases that the gold queries would have caught otherwise.



Evaluation steps:

1. Understand the Database Schema: Identify all tables used in both queries. List all columns referenced, along with their data types and constraints. Determine primary and foreign key relationships. Note any indexes or unique constraints that may affect query execution.
2. Parse and Break Down Each Query: Identify selected columns, functions, and expressions. Note the tables involved and the join conditions. Understand the filtering conditions applied. Identify grouping and aggregate conditions, if any. Determine if result ordering affects equivalence.
3. Compare Query Components: Check if both queries use the same tables and join conditions. Compare filtering conditions in the WHERE clauses. Assess whether the same columns and expressions are selected. Identify if different functions or syntaxes achieve the same result. Look for logical equivalence in expressions and calculations.
4. Consider Edge Cases and Data Variations: Conceptualize sample datasets that include edge cases (e.g., NULL values, zero values, special characters). Analyze how each query handles these edge cases. Ensure that data type differences do not affect the outcome. Verify that constraints (e.g., NOT NULL, UNIQUE) are accounted for.
5. Evaluate Aggregations and Calculations: Confirm that aggregate functions (e.g., SUM, COUNT) are applied identically. Ensure calculations (e.g., subtraction, addition) produce the same results.
6. Check for Logical Equivalence in Conditional Expressions: Compare conditional expressions like IIF, CASE WHEN, and IF. Determine if conditions and returned values are logically the same.
7. Assess Ordering of Results: If ORDER BY clause is present, confirm that both queries order results identically. Recognize that differing order may affect equivalence if result order is significant.
8. Generate a New Logical Equivalence Rule (If Applicable): Create an "Equivalent Queries: <query1>
<query2>
Schema Conditions:<conditions>" statement that defines the equivalence. Use GENERALIZED COLUMN and TABLE NAMES. Specify any necessary conditions based on the database schema. Present the rule clearly, indicating both the equivalence and the conditions under which it holds.



Example Equivalence Rules:

<Rule>
Equivalent Queries:
SELECT c1 from t1 WHERE ...;
SELECT c1 FROM t1 WHERE ...;
Schema Conditions:
None.
</Rule>



# Guidelines:
- Make SURE complete to every step PERFECTLY without ANY Mistakes
- Follow the Rules I Gave you and Remember to AVOID generating repeated equivalence rules in the examples I gave you.
- Be sure to format your response like the example equivalence rules I gave you.
- Put <New Rule></New Rule> around the new equivalence rule that you think of. Do not use other formatting around the equivalent queries.
- Use GENERALIZED COLUMN AND TABLE NAMES in any EQUIVALENCE RULE YOU WRITE. DO NOT USE THE SAME NAMES IN THE PROVIDED QUERY PAIRS!!!!
- If the two queries are not logically equivalent, say <New Rule> Not equivalent </New Rule>.
- If the new equivalence rule is already repeated in the examples listed, say <New Rule> Rule exists </New Rule>.
- The new rule should be be MINIMAL to CLEARLY demonstrate the highlighted semantic difference. Use ellipses to shorten SQL queries where necessary to achieve this.

Take a Deep Breath and Carefully Follow the Rules, Guides and Examples I gave you. I will tip you $2000 if you do EVERYTHING Perfectly.



Pair of SQL Queries:
<Gold SQL Query>
SELECT COUNT(T1.Id) FROM posts AS T1 INNER JOIN users AS T2 ON T1.OwnerUserId = T2.Id WHERE T1.Score >= 20 AND T2.Age > 65;
</Gold SQL Query>

<Machine-generated SQL Query>
SELECT count(posts.id) FROM users INNER JOIN posts ON users.id = posts.owneruserid WHERE users.age > 65 AND posts.score > 19;
</Machine-generated SQL Query>

INFO:root:model: gpt-4o
INFO:root:prompt: You are an expert SQL engineer with 20+ years of experience. You will be given some SQL equivalence rules conditional on some database schemas. You will then be given a pair of SQL queries, consisting of a gold query and a machine-generated query, and a database schema that defines the context of the queries. 

Your task is to compare the two provided SQL queries on logical equivalence and generate one more equivalence rule in the same format as the provided example equivalence rules.

Please make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please also keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.



Evaluation Criteria:

Logical equivalence - the alignment between the gold SQL query and the machine-generated SQL query. A machine-generated SQL query is logically equivalent to the gold query if these two queries would RETURN THE SAME RESULTS AND IN THE SAME ORDER for ALL POSSIBLE DATABASE INSTANCES that satisfy the provided database schema for these queries. Annotators were asked to penalize machine-generated queries that overlooked edge cases that the gold queries would have caught otherwise.



Evaluation steps:

1. Understand the Database Schema: Identify all tables used in both queries. List all columns referenced, along with their data types and constraints. Determine primary and foreign key relationships. Note any indexes or unique constraints that may affect query execution.
2. Parse and Break Down Each Query: Identify selected columns, functions, and expressions. Note the tables involved and the join conditions. Understand the filtering conditions applied. Identify grouping and aggregate conditions, if any. Determine if result ordering affects equivalence.
3. Compare Query Components: Check if both queries use the same tables and join conditions. Compare filtering conditions in the WHERE clauses. Assess whether the same columns and expressions are selected. Identify if different functions or syntaxes achieve the same result. Look for logical equivalence in expressions and calculations.
4. Consider Edge Cases and Data Variations: Conceptualize sample datasets that include edge cases (e.g., NULL values, zero values, special characters). Analyze how each query handles these edge cases. Ensure that data type differences do not affect the outcome. Verify that constraints (e.g., NOT NULL, UNIQUE) are accounted for.
5. Evaluate Aggregations and Calculations: Confirm that aggregate functions (e.g., SUM, COUNT) are applied identically. Ensure calculations (e.g., subtraction, addition) produce the same results.
6. Check for Logical Equivalence in Conditional Expressions: Compare conditional expressions like IIF, CASE WHEN, and IF. Determine if conditions and returned values are logically the same.
7. Assess Ordering of Results: If ORDER BY clause is present, confirm that both queries order results identically. Recognize that differing order may affect equivalence if result order is significant.
8. Generate a New Logical Equivalence Rule (If Applicable): Create an "Equivalent Queries: <query1>
<query2>
Schema Conditions:<conditions>" statement that defines the equivalence. Use GENERALIZED COLUMN and TABLE NAMES. Specify any necessary conditions based on the database schema. Present the rule clearly, indicating both the equivalence and the conditions under which it holds.



Example Equivalence Rules:

<Rule>
Equivalent Queries:
SELECT c1 from t1 WHERE ...;
SELECT c1 FROM t1 WHERE ...;
Schema Conditions:
None.
</Rule>



# Guidelines:
- Make SURE complete to every step PERFECTLY without ANY Mistakes
- Follow the Rules I Gave you and Remember to AVOID generating repeated equivalence rules in the examples I gave you.
- Be sure to format your response like the example equivalence rules I gave you.
- Put <New Rule></New Rule> around the new equivalence rule that you think of. Do not use other formatting around the equivalent queries.
- Use GENERALIZED COLUMN AND TABLE NAMES in any EQUIVALENCE RULE YOU WRITE. DO NOT USE THE SAME NAMES IN THE PROVIDED QUERY PAIRS!!!!
- If the two queries are not logically equivalent, say <New Rule> Not equivalent </New Rule>.
- If the new equivalence rule is already repeated in the examples listed, say <New Rule> Rule exists </New Rule>.
- The new rule should be be MINIMAL to CLEARLY demonstrate the highlighted semantic difference. Use ellipses to shorten SQL queries where necessary to achieve this.

Take a Deep Breath and Carefully Follow the Rules, Guides and Examples I gave you. I will tip you $2000 if you do EVERYTHING Perfectly.



Pair of SQL Queries:
<Gold SQL Query>
SELECT T2.Body FROM tags AS T1 INNER JOIN posts AS T2 ON T2.Id = T1.ExcerptPostId WHERE T1.TagName = 'bayesian';
</Gold SQL Query>

<Machine-generated SQL Query>
SELECT posts.body FROM tags INNER JOIN posts ON tags.excerptpostid = posts.id WHERE tags.tagname = 'bayesian';

INFO:root:prompt: You are an expert SQL engineer with 20+ years of experience. You will be given some SQL equivalence rules conditional on some database schemas. You will then be given a pair of SQL queries, consisting of a gold query and a machine-generated query, and a database schema that defines the context of the queries. 

Your task is to compare the two provided SQL queries on logical equivalence and generate one more equivalence rule in the same format as the provided example equivalence rules.

Please make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please also keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.



Evaluation Criteria:

Logical equivalence - the alignment between the gold SQL query and the machine-generated SQL query. A machine-generated SQL query is logically equivalent to the gold query if these two queries would RETURN THE SAME RESULTS AND IN THE SAME ORDER for ALL POSSIBLE DATABASE INSTANCES that satisfy the provided database schema for these queries. Annotators were asked to penalize machine-generated queries that overlooked edge cases that the gold queries would have caught otherwise.



Evaluation steps:

1. Understand the Database Schema: Identify all tables used in both queries. List all columns referenced, along with their data types and constraints. Determine primary and foreign key relationships. Note any indexes or unique constraints that may affect query execution.
2. Parse and Break Down Each Query: Identify selected columns, functions, and expressions. Note the tables involved and the join conditions. Understand the filtering conditions applied. Identify grouping and aggregate conditions, if any. Determine if result ordering affects equivalence.
3. Compare Query Components: Check if both queries use the same tables and join conditions. Compare filtering conditions in the WHERE clauses. Assess whether the same columns and expressions are selected. Identify if different functions or syntaxes achieve the same result. Look for logical equivalence in expressions and calculations.
4. Consider Edge Cases and Data Variations: Conceptualize sample datasets that include edge cases (e.g., NULL values, zero values, special characters). Analyze how each query handles these edge cases. Ensure that data type differences do not affect the outcome. Verify that constraints (e.g., NOT NULL, UNIQUE) are accounted for.
5. Evaluate Aggregations and Calculations: Confirm that aggregate functions (e.g., SUM, COUNT) are applied identically. Ensure calculations (e.g., subtraction, addition) produce the same results.
6. Check for Logical Equivalence in Conditional Expressions: Compare conditional expressions like IIF, CASE WHEN, and IF. Determine if conditions and returned values are logically the same.
7. Assess Ordering of Results: If ORDER BY clause is present, confirm that both queries order results identically. Recognize that differing order may affect equivalence if result order is significant.
8. Generate a New Logical Equivalence Rule (If Applicable): Create an "Equivalent Queries: <query1>
<query2>
Schema Conditions:<conditions>" statement that defines the equivalence. Use GENERALIZED COLUMN and TABLE NAMES. Specify any necessary conditions based on the database schema. Present the rule clearly, indicating both the equivalence and the conditions under which it holds.



Example Equivalence Rules:

<Rule>
Equivalent Queries:
SELECT c1 from t1 WHERE ...;
SELECT c1 FROM t1 WHERE ...;
Schema Conditions:
None.
</Rule>



# Guidelines:
- Make SURE complete to every step PERFECTLY without ANY Mistakes
- Follow the Rules I Gave you and Remember to AVOID generating repeated equivalence rules in the examples I gave you.
- Be sure to format your response like the example equivalence rules I gave you.
- Put <New Rule></New Rule> around the new equivalence rule that you think of. Do not use other formatting around the equivalent queries.
- Use GENERALIZED COLUMN AND TABLE NAMES in any EQUIVALENCE RULE YOU WRITE. DO NOT USE THE SAME NAMES IN THE PROVIDED QUERY PAIRS!!!!
- If the two queries are not logically equivalent, say <New Rule> Not equivalent </New Rule>.
- If the new equivalence rule is already repeated in the examples listed, say <New Rule> Rule exists </New Rule>.
- The new rule should be be MINIMAL to CLEARLY demonstrate the highlighted semantic difference. Use ellipses to shorten SQL queries where necessary to achieve this.

Take a Deep Breath and Carefully Follow the Rules, Guides and Examples I gave you. I will tip you $2000 if you do EVERYTHING Perfectly.

</Gold SQL Query>

<Machine-generated SQL Query>

INFO:root:model: gpt-4o
INFO:root:prompt: You are an expert SQL engineer with 20+ years of experience. You will be given some SQL equivalence rules conditional on some database schemas. You will then be given a pair of SQL queries, consisting of a gold query and a machine-generated query, and a database schema that defines the context of the queries. 

Your task is to compare the two provided SQL queries on logical equivalence and generate one more equivalence rule in the same format as the provided example equivalence rules.

Please make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please also keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.



Evaluation Criteria:

Logical equivalence - the alignment between the gold SQL query and the machine-generated SQL query. A machine-generated SQL query is logically equivalent to the gold query if these two queries would RETURN THE SAME RESULTS AND IN THE SAME ORDER for ALL POSSIBLE DATABASE INSTANCES that satisfy the provided database schema for these queries. Annotators were asked to penalize machine-generated queries that overlooked edge cases that the gold queries would have caught otherwise.



Evaluation steps:

1. Understand the Database Schema: Identify all tables used in both queries. List all columns referenced, along with their data types and constraints. Determine primary and foreign key relationships. Note any indexes or unique constraints that may affect query execution.
2. Parse and Break Down Each Query: Identify selected columns, functions, and expressions. Note the tables involved and the join conditions. Understand the filtering conditions applied. Identify grouping and aggregate conditions, if any. Determine if result ordering affects equivalence.
3. Compare Query Components: Check if both queries use the same tables and join conditions. Compare filtering conditions in the WHERE clauses. Assess whether the same columns and expressions are selected. Identify if different functions or syntaxes achieve the same result. Look for logical equivalence in expressions and calculations.
4. Consider Edge Cases and Data Variations: Conceptualize sample datasets that include edge cases (e.g., NULL values, zero values, special characters). Analyze how each query handles these edge cases. Ensure that data type differences do not affect the outcome. Verify that constraints (e.g., NOT NULL, UNIQUE) are accounted for.
5. Evaluate Aggregations and Calculations: Confirm that aggregate functions (e.g., SUM, COUNT) are applied identically. Ensure calculations (e.g., subtraction, addition) produce the same results.
6. Check for Logical Equivalence in Conditional Expressions: Compare conditional expressions like IIF, CASE WHEN, and IF. Determine if conditions and returned values are logically the same.
7. Assess Ordering of Results: If ORDER BY clause is present, confirm that both queries order results identically. Recognize that differing order may affect equivalence if result order is significant.
8. Generate a New Logical Equivalence Rule (If Applicable): Create an "Equivalent Queries: <query1>
<query2>
Schema Conditions:<conditions>" statement that defines the equivalence. Use GENERALIZED COLUMN and TABLE NAMES. Specify any necessary conditions based on the database schema. Present the rule clearly, indicating both the equivalence and the conditions under which it holds.



Example Equivalence Rules:

<Rule>
Equivalent Queries:
SELECT c1 from t1 WHERE ...;
SELECT c1 FROM t1 WHERE ...;
Schema Conditions:
None.
</Rule>



# Guidelines:
- Make SURE complete to every step PERFECTLY without ANY Mistakes
- Follow the Rules I Gave you and Remember to AVOID generating repeated equivalence rules in the examples I gave you.
- Be sure to format your response like the example equivalence rules I gave you.
- Put <New Rule></New Rule> around the new equivalence rule that you think of. Do not use other formatting around the equivalent queries.
- Use GENERALIZED COLUMN AND TABLE NAMES in any EQUIVALENCE RULE YOU WRITE. DO NOT USE THE SAME NAMES IN THE PROVIDED QUERY PAIRS!!!!
- If the two queries are not logically equivalent, say <New Rule> Not equivalent </New Rule>.
- If the new equivalence rule is already repeated in the examples listed, say <New Rule> Rule exists </New Rule>.
- The new rule should be be MINIMAL to CLEARLY demonstrate the highlighted semantic difference. Use ellipses to shorten SQL queries where necessary to achieve this.

Take a Deep Breath and Carefully Follow the Rules, Guides and Examples I gave you. I will tip you $2000 if you do EVERYTHING Perfectly.

INFO:root:model: gpt-4o
INFO:root:prompt: You are an expert SQL engineer with 20+ years of experience. You will be given some SQL equivalence rules conditional on some database schemas. You will then be given a pair of SQL queries, consisting of a gold query and a machine-generated query, and a database schema that defines the context of the queries. 

Your task is to compare the two provided SQL queries on logical equivalence and generate one more equivalence rule in the same format as the provided example equivalence rules.

Please make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please also keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.



Evaluation Criteria:

Logical equivalence - the alignment between the gold SQL query and the machine-generated SQL query. A machine-generated SQL query is logically equivalent to the gold query if these two queries would RETURN THE SAME RESULTS AND IN THE SAME ORDER for ALL POSSIBLE DATABASE INSTANCES that satisfy the provided database schema for these queries. Annotators were asked to penalize machine-generated queries that overlooked edge cases that the gold queries would have caught otherwise.



Evaluation steps:

1. Understand the Database Schema: Identify all tables used in both queries. List all columns referenced, along with their data types and constraints. Determine primary and foreign key relationships. Note any indexes or unique constraints that may affect query execution.
2. Parse and Break Down Each Query: Identify selected columns, functions, and expressions. Note the tables involved and the join conditions. Understand the filtering conditions applied. Identify grouping and aggregate conditions, if any. Determine if result ordering affects equivalence.
3. Compare Query Components: Check if both queries use the same tables and join conditions. Compare filtering conditions in the WHERE clauses. Assess whether the same columns and expressions are selected. Identify if different functions or syntaxes achieve the same result. Look for logical equivalence in expressions and calculations.
4. Consider Edge Cases and Data Variations: Conceptualize sample datasets that include edge cases (e.g., NULL values, zero values, special characters). Analyze how each query handles these edge cases. Ensure that data type differences do not affect the outcome. Verify that constraints (e.g., NOT NULL, UNIQUE) are accounted for.
5. Evaluate Aggregations and Calculations: Confirm that aggregate functions (e.g., SUM, COUNT) are applied identically. Ensure calculations (e.g., subtraction, addition) produce the same results.
6. Check for Logical Equivalence in Conditional Expressions: Compare conditional expressions like IIF, CASE WHEN, and IF. Determine if conditions and returned values are logically the same.
7. Assess Ordering of Results: If ORDER BY clause is present, confirm that both queries order results identically. Recognize that differing order may affect equivalence if result order is significant.
8. Generate a New Logical Equivalence Rule (If Applicable): Create an "Equivalent Queries: <query1>
<query2>
Schema Conditions:<conditions>" statement that defines the equivalence. Use GENERALIZED COLUMN and TABLE NAMES. Specify any necessary conditions based on the database schema. Present the rule clearly, indicating both the equivalence and the conditions under which it holds.



Example Equivalence Rules:

<Rule>
Equivalent Queries:
SELECT c1 from t1 WHERE ...;
SELECT c1 FROM t1 WHERE ...;
Schema Conditions:
None.
</Rule>



# Guidelines:
- Make SURE complete to every step PERFECTLY without ANY Mistakes
- Follow the Rules I Gave you and Remember to AVOID generating repeated equivalence rules in the examples I gave you.
- Be sure to format your response like the example equivalence rules I gave you.
- Put <New Rule></New Rule> around the new equivalence rule that you think of. Do not use other formatting around the equivalent queries.
- Use GENERALIZED COLUMN AND TABLE NAMES in any EQUIVALENCE RULE YOU WRITE. DO NOT USE THE SAME NAMES IN THE PROVIDED QUERY PAIRS!!!!
- If the two queries are not logically equivalent, say <New Rule> Not equivalent </New Rule>.
- If the new equivalence rule is already repeated in the examples listed, say <New Rule> Rule exists </New Rule>.
- The new rule should be be MINIMAL to CLEARLY demonstrate the highlighted semantic difference. Use ellipses to shorten SQL queries where necessary to achieve this.

INFO:root:model: gpt-4o
INFO:root:prompt: You are an expert SQL engineer with 20+ years of experience. You will be given some SQL equivalence rules conditional on some database schemas. You will then be given a pair of SQL queries, consisting of a gold query and a machine-generated query, and a database schema that defines the context of the queries. 

Your task is to compare the two provided SQL queries on logical equivalence and generate one more equivalence rule in the same format as the provided example equivalence rules.

Please make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please also keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.



Evaluation Criteria:

Logical equivalence - the alignment between the gold SQL query and the machine-generated SQL query. A machine-generated SQL query is logically equivalent to the gold query if these two queries would RETURN THE SAME RESULTS AND IN THE SAME ORDER for ALL POSSIBLE DATABASE INSTANCES that satisfy the provided database schema for these queries. Annotators were asked to penalize machine-generated queries that overlooked edge cases that the gold queries would have caught otherwise.



Evaluation steps:

1. Understand the Database Schema: Identify all tables used in both queries. List all columns referenced, along with their data types and constraints. Determine primary and foreign key relationships. Note any indexes or unique constraints that may affect query execution.
2. Parse and Break Down Each Query: Identify selected columns, functions, and expressions. Note the tables involved and the join conditions. Understand the filtering conditions applied. Identify grouping and aggregate conditions, if any. Determine if result ordering affects equivalence.
3. Compare Query Components: Check if both queries use the same tables and join conditions. Compare filtering conditions in the WHERE clauses. Assess whether the same columns and expressions are selected. Identify if different functions or syntaxes achieve the same result. Look for logical equivalence in expressions and calculations.
4. Consider Edge Cases and Data Variations: Conceptualize sample datasets that include edge cases (e.g., NULL values, zero values, special characters). Analyze how each query handles these edge cases. Ensure that data type differences do not affect the outcome. Verify that constraints (e.g., NOT NULL, UNIQUE) are accounted for.
5. Evaluate Aggregations and Calculations: Confirm that aggregate functions (e.g., SUM, COUNT) are applied identically. Ensure calculations (e.g., subtraction, addition) produce the same results.
6. Check for Logical Equivalence in Conditional Expressions: Compare conditional expressions like IIF, CASE WHEN, and IF. Determine if conditions and returned values are logically the same.
7. Assess Ordering of Results: If ORDER BY clause is present, confirm that both queries order results identically. Recognize that differing order may affect equivalence if result order is significant.
8. Generate a New Logical Equivalence Rule (If Applicable): Create an "Equivalent Queries: <query1>
<query2>
Schema Conditions:<conditions>" statement that defines the equivalence. Use GENERALIZED COLUMN and TABLE NAMES. Specify any necessary conditions based on the database schema. Present the rule clearly, indicating both the equivalence and the conditions under which it holds.



Example Equivalence Rules:

<Rule>
Equivalent Queries:
SELECT c1 from t1 WHERE ...;
SELECT c1 FROM t1 WHERE ...;
Schema Conditions:
None.
</Rule>



# Guidelines:
- Make SURE complete to every step PERFECTLY without ANY Mistakes
- Follow the Rules I Gave you and Remember to AVOID generating repeated equivalence rules in the examples I gave you.
- Be sure to format your response like the example equivalence rules I gave you.
- Put <New Rule></New Rule> around the new equivalence rule that you think of. Do not use other formatting around the equivalent queries.
- Use GENERALIZED COLUMN AND TABLE NAMES in any EQUIVALENCE RULE YOU WRITE. DO NOT USE THE SAME NAMES IN THE PROVIDED QUERY PAIRS!!!!
- If the two queries are not logically equivalent, say <New Rule> Not equivalent </New Rule>.
- If the new equivalence rule is already repeated in the examples listed, say <New Rule> Rule exists </New Rule>.
- The new rule should be be MINIMAL to CLEARLY demonstrate the highlighted semantic difference. Use ellipses to shorten SQL queries where necessary to achieve this.

Take a Deep Breath and Carefully Follow the Rules, Guides and Examples I gave you. I will tip you $2000 if you do EVERYTHING Perfectly.

However, since it's an INNER JOIN, NULL `UserId` values will not affect the result set.\n- **Data Type Differences**: There are no data type differences that would affect the outcome.\n- **Constraints**: No constraints are violated in either query.\n\n### Step 5: Evaluate Aggregations and Calculations\n\n- There are no aggregations or calculations in either query.\n\n### Step 6: Check for Logical Equivalence in Conditional Expressions\n\n- Both queries have identical filter conditions and join logic.\n\n### Step 7: Assess Ordering of Results\n\n- Neither query specifies an `ORDER BY` clause, so result order is not a consideration for equivalence.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBoth queries are logically equivalent, as they select the same data under the same conditions and join logic.\n\n### Step 8: Generate a New Logical Equivalence Rule\n\nSince the queries are logically equivalent, let's provide a new equivalence rule:\n\n<New Rule>\nEquivalent Queries:\nSELECT t1.c1 FROM t2 INNER JOIN t1 ON t2.c2 = t1.c3 WHERE t2.c4 = 'value';\nSELECT t1.c1 FROM t2 INNER JOIN t1 ON t2.c2 = t1.c3 WHERE t2.c4 = 'value';\nSchema Conditions:\nNone.\n", role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None, refusal=None))], created=1732079537, model='gpt-4o-2024-08-06', object='chat.completion', system_fingerprint='fp_831e067d82', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=728, prompt_tokens=1918, total_tokens=2646, prompt_tokens_details={'cached_tokens': 0, 'audio_tokens': 0}, completion_tokens_details={'reasoning_tokens': 0, 'audio_tokens': 0, 'accepted_prediction_tokens': 0, 'rejected_prediction_tokens': 0}))

INFO:root:model: gpt-4o
INFO:root:prompt: You are an expert SQL engineer with 20+ years of experience. You will be given some SQL equivalence rules conditional on some database schemas. You will then be given a pair of SQL queries, consisting of a gold query and a machine-generated query, and a database schema that defines the context of the queries. 

Your task is to compare the two provided SQL queries on logical equivalence and generate one more equivalence rule in the same format as the provided example equivalence rules.

Please make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please also keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.



Evaluation Criteria:

Logical equivalence - the alignment between the gold SQL query and the machine-generated SQL query. A machine-generated SQL query is logically equivalent to the gold query if these two queries would RETURN THE SAME RESULTS AND IN THE SAME ORDER for ALL POSSIBLE DATABASE INSTANCES that satisfy the provided database schema for these queries. Annotators were asked to penalize machine-generated queries that overlooked edge cases that the gold queries would have caught otherwise.



Evaluation steps:

1. Understand the Database Schema: Identify all tables used in both queries. List all columns referenced, along with their data types and constraints. Determine primary and foreign key relationships. Note any indexes or unique constraints that may affect query execution.
2. Parse and Break Down Each Query: Identify selected columns, functions, and expressions. Note the tables involved and the join conditions. Understand the filtering conditions applied. Identify grouping and aggregate conditions, if any. Determine if result ordering affects equivalence.
3. Compare Query Components: Check if both queries use the same tables and join conditions. Compare filtering conditions in the WHERE clauses. Assess whether the same columns and expressions are selected. Identify if different functions or syntaxes achieve the same result. Look for logical equivalence in expressions and calculations.
4. Consider Edge Cases and Data Variations: Conceptualize sample datasets that include edge cases (e.g., NULL values, zero values, special characters). Analyze how each query handles these edge cases. Ensure that data type differences do not affect the outcome. Verify that constraints (e.g., NOT NULL, UNIQUE) are accounted for.
5. Evaluate Aggregations and Calculations: Confirm that aggregate functions (e.g., SUM, COUNT) are applied identically. Ensure calculations (e.g., subtraction, addition) produce the same results.
6. Check for Logical Equivalence in Conditional Expressions: Compare conditional expressions like IIF, CASE WHEN, and IF. Determine if conditions and returned values are logically the same.
7. Assess Ordering of Results: If ORDER BY clause is present, confirm that both queries order results identically. Recognize that differing order may affect equivalence if result order is significant.
8. Generate a New Logical Equivalence Rule (If Applicable): Create an "Equivalent Queries: <query1>
<query2>
Schema Conditions:<conditions>" statement that defines the equivalence. Use GENERALIZED COLUMN and TABLE NAMES. Specify any necessary conditions based on the database schema. Present the rule clearly, indicating both the equivalence and the conditions under which it holds.



Example Equivalence Rules:

<Rule>
Equivalent Queries:
SELECT c1 from t1 WHERE ...;
SELECT c1 FROM t1 WHERE ...;
Schema Conditions:
None.
</Rule>



# Guidelines:
- Make SURE complete to every step PERFECTLY without ANY Mistakes
- Follow the Rules I Gave you and Remember to AVOID generating repeated equivalence rules in the examples I gave you.
- Be sure to format your response like the example equivalence rules I gave you.
- Put <New Rule></New Rule> around the new equivalence rule that you think of. Do not use other formatting around the equivalent queries.
- Use GENERALIZED COLUMN AND TABLE NAMES in any EQUIVALENCE RULE YOU WRITE. DO NOT USE THE SAME NAMES IN THE PROVIDED QUERY PAIRS!!!!
- If the two queries are not logically equivalent, say <New Rule> Not equivalent </New Rule>.
- If the new equivalence rule is already repeated in the examples listed, say <New Rule> Rule exists </New Rule>.
- The new rule should be be MINIMAL to CLEARLY demonstrate the highlighted semantic difference. Use ellipses to shorten SQL queries where necessary to achieve this.

Take a Deep Breath and Carefully Follow the Rules, Guides and Examples I gave you. I will tip you $2000 if you do EVERYTHING Perfectly.

<Gold SQL Query>
SELECT T2.DisplayName FROM posts AS T1 INNER JOIN users AS T2 ON T1.OwnerUserId = T2.Id WHERE T1.Title = 'Open source tools for visualizing multi-dimensional data?';

INFO:root:prompt: You are an expert SQL engineer with 20+ years of experience. You will be given some SQL equivalence rules conditional on some database schemas. You will then be given a pair of SQL queries, consisting of a gold query and a machine-generated query, and a database schema that defines the context of the queries. 

Your task is to compare the two provided SQL queries on logical equivalence and generate one more equivalence rule in the same format as the provided example equivalence rules.

Please make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please also keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.



Evaluation Criteria:

Logical equivalence - the alignment between the gold SQL query and the machine-generated SQL query. A machine-generated SQL query is logically equivalent to the gold query if these two queries would RETURN THE SAME RESULTS AND IN THE SAME ORDER for ALL POSSIBLE DATABASE INSTANCES that satisfy the provided database schema for these queries. Annotators were asked to penalize machine-generated queries that overlooked edge cases that the gold queries would have caught otherwise.



Evaluation steps:

1. Understand the Database Schema: Identify all tables used in both queries. List all columns referenced, along with their data types and constraints. Determine primary and foreign key relationships. Note any indexes or unique constraints that may affect query execution.
2. Parse and Break Down Each Query: Identify selected columns, functions, and expressions. Note the tables involved and the join conditions. Understand the filtering conditions applied. Identify grouping and aggregate conditions, if any. Determine if result ordering affects equivalence.
3. Compare Query Components: Check if both queries use the same tables and join conditions. Compare filtering conditions in the WHERE clauses. Assess whether the same columns and expressions are selected. Identify if different functions or syntaxes achieve the same result. Look for logical equivalence in expressions and calculations.
4. Consider Edge Cases and Data Variations: Conceptualize sample datasets that include edge cases (e.g., NULL values, zero values, special characters). Analyze how each query handles these edge cases. Ensure that data type differences do not affect the outcome. Verify that constraints (e.g., NOT NULL, UNIQUE) are accounted for.
5. Evaluate Aggregations and Calculations: Confirm that aggregate functions (e.g., SUM, COUNT) are applied identically. Ensure calculations (e.g., subtraction, addition) produce the same results.
6. Check for Logical Equivalence in Conditional Expressions: Compare conditional expressions like IIF, CASE WHEN, and IF. Determine if conditions and returned values are logically the same.
7. Assess Ordering of Results: If ORDER BY clause is present, confirm that both queries order results identically. Recognize that differing order may affect equivalence if result order is significant.
8. Generate a New Logical Equivalence Rule (If Applicable): Create an "Equivalent Queries: <query1>
<query2>
Schema Conditions:<conditions>" statement that defines the equivalence. Use GENERALIZED COLUMN and TABLE NAMES. Specify any necessary conditions based on the database schema. Present the rule clearly, indicating both the equivalence and the conditions under which it holds.



Example Equivalence Rules:

<Rule>
Equivalent Queries:
SELECT c1 from t1 WHERE ...;
SELECT c1 FROM t1 WHERE ...;
Schema Conditions:
None.
</Rule>



# Guidelines:
- Make SURE complete to every step PERFECTLY without ANY Mistakes
- Follow the Rules I Gave you and Remember to AVOID generating repeated equivalence rules in the examples I gave you.
- Be sure to format your response like the example equivalence rules I gave you.
- Put <New Rule></New Rule> around the new equivalence rule that you think of. Do not use other formatting around the equivalent queries.
- Use GENERALIZED COLUMN AND TABLE NAMES in any EQUIVALENCE RULE YOU WRITE. DO NOT USE THE SAME NAMES IN THE PROVIDED QUERY PAIRS!!!!
- If the two queries are not logically equivalent, say <New Rule> Not equivalent </New Rule>.
- If the new equivalence rule is already repeated in the examples listed, say <New Rule> Rule exists </New Rule>.
- The new rule should be be MINIMAL to CLEARLY demonstrate the highlighted semantic difference. Use ellipses to shorten SQL queries where necessary to achieve this.

Take a Deep Breath and Carefully Follow the Rules, Guides and Examples I gave you. I will tip you $2000 if you do EVERYTHING Perfectly.

<Gold SQL Query>
SELECT T2.Comment FROM posts AS T1 INNER JOIN postHistory AS T2 ON T1.Id = T2.PostId WHERE T1.Title = 'Why square the difference instead of taking the absolute value in standard deviation?';
</Gold SQL Query>

<Machine-generated SQL Query>

INFO:root:model: gpt-4o
INFO:root:prompt: You are an expert SQL engineer with 20+ years of experience. You will be given some SQL equivalence rules conditional on some database schemas. You will then be given a pair of SQL queries, consisting of a gold query and a machine-generated query, and a database schema that defines the context of the queries. 

Your task is to compare the two provided SQL queries on logical equivalence and generate one more equivalence rule in the same format as the provided example equivalence rules.

Please make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please also keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.



Evaluation Criteria:

Logical equivalence - the alignment between the gold SQL query and the machine-generated SQL query. A machine-generated SQL query is logically equivalent to the gold query if these two queries would RETURN THE SAME RESULTS AND IN THE SAME ORDER for ALL POSSIBLE DATABASE INSTANCES that satisfy the provided database schema for these queries. Annotators were asked to penalize machine-generated queries that overlooked edge cases that the gold queries would have caught otherwise.



Evaluation steps:

1. Understand the Database Schema: Identify all tables used in both queries. List all columns referenced, along with their data types and constraints. Determine primary and foreign key relationships. Note any indexes or unique constraints that may affect query execution.
2. Parse and Break Down Each Query: Identify selected columns, functions, and expressions. Note the tables involved and the join conditions. Understand the filtering conditions applied. Identify grouping and aggregate conditions, if any. Determine if result ordering affects equivalence.
3. Compare Query Components: Check if both queries use the same tables and join conditions. Compare filtering conditions in the WHERE clauses. Assess whether the same columns and expressions are selected. Identify if different functions or syntaxes achieve the same result. Look for logical equivalence in expressions and calculations.
4. Consider Edge Cases and Data Variations: Conceptualize sample datasets that include edge cases (e.g., NULL values, zero values, special characters). Analyze how each query handles these edge cases. Ensure that data type differences do not affect the outcome. Verify that constraints (e.g., NOT NULL, UNIQUE) are accounted for.
5. Evaluate Aggregations and Calculations: Confirm that aggregate functions (e.g., SUM, COUNT) are applied identically. Ensure calculations (e.g., subtraction, addition) produce the same results.
6. Check for Logical Equivalence in Conditional Expressions: Compare conditional expressions like IIF, CASE WHEN, and IF. Determine if conditions and returned values are logically the same.
7. Assess Ordering of Results: If ORDER BY clause is present, confirm that both queries order results identically. Recognize that differing order may affect equivalence if result order is significant.
8. Generate a New Logical Equivalence Rule (If Applicable): Create an "Equivalent Queries: <query1>
<query2>
Schema Conditions:<conditions>" statement that defines the equivalence. Use GENERALIZED COLUMN and TABLE NAMES. Specify any necessary conditions based on the database schema. Present the rule clearly, indicating both the equivalence and the conditions under which it holds.



Example Equivalence Rules:

<Rule>
Equivalent Queries:
SELECT c1 from t1 WHERE ...;
SELECT c1 FROM t1 WHERE ...;
Schema Conditions:
None.
</Rule>



# Guidelines:
- Make SURE complete to every step PERFECTLY without ANY Mistakes
- Follow the Rules I Gave you and Remember to AVOID generating repeated equivalence rules in the examples I gave you.
- Be sure to format your response like the example equivalence rules I gave you.
- Put <New Rule></New Rule> around the new equivalence rule that you think of. Do not use other formatting around the equivalent queries.
- Use GENERALIZED COLUMN AND TABLE NAMES in any EQUIVALENCE RULE YOU WRITE. DO NOT USE THE SAME NAMES IN THE PROVIDED QUERY PAIRS!!!!
- If the two queries are not logically equivalent, say <New Rule> Not equivalent </New Rule>.
- If the new equivalence rule is already repeated in the examples listed, say <New Rule> Rule exists </New Rule>.
- The new rule should be be MINIMAL to CLEARLY demonstrate the highlighted semantic difference. Use ellipses to shorten SQL queries where necessary to achieve this.

Take a Deep Breath and Carefully Follow the Rules, Guides and Examples I gave you. I will tip you $2000 if you do EVERYTHING Perfectly.

</Gold SQL Query>

<Machine-generated SQL Query>
SELECT cast(sum(CASE WHEN votes.creationdate LIKE '2010%' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS REAL) / sum(CASE WHEN votes.creationdate LIKE '2011%' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) FROM votes;

INFO:root:model: gpt-4o
INFO:root:prompt: You are an expert SQL engineer with 20+ years of experience. You will be given some SQL equivalence rules conditional on some database schemas. You will then be given a pair of SQL queries, consisting of a gold query and a machine-generated query, and a database schema that defines the context of the queries. 

Your task is to compare the two provided SQL queries on logical equivalence and generate one more equivalence rule in the same format as the provided example equivalence rules.

Please make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please also keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.



Evaluation Criteria:

Logical equivalence - the alignment between the gold SQL query and the machine-generated SQL query. A machine-generated SQL query is logically equivalent to the gold query if these two queries would RETURN THE SAME RESULTS AND IN THE SAME ORDER for ALL POSSIBLE DATABASE INSTANCES that satisfy the provided database schema for these queries. Annotators were asked to penalize machine-generated queries that overlooked edge cases that the gold queries would have caught otherwise.



Evaluation steps:

1. Understand the Database Schema: Identify all tables used in both queries. List all columns referenced, along with their data types and constraints. Determine primary and foreign key relationships. Note any indexes or unique constraints that may affect query execution.
2. Parse and Break Down Each Query: Identify selected columns, functions, and expressions. Note the tables involved and the join conditions. Understand the filtering conditions applied. Identify grouping and aggregate conditions, if any. Determine if result ordering affects equivalence.
3. Compare Query Components: Check if both queries use the same tables and join conditions. Compare filtering conditions in the WHERE clauses. Assess whether the same columns and expressions are selected. Identify if different functions or syntaxes achieve the same result. Look for logical equivalence in expressions and calculations.
4. Consider Edge Cases and Data Variations: Conceptualize sample datasets that include edge cases (e.g., NULL values, zero values, special characters). Analyze how each query handles these edge cases. Ensure that data type differences do not affect the outcome. Verify that constraints (e.g., NOT NULL, UNIQUE) are accounted for.
5. Evaluate Aggregations and Calculations: Confirm that aggregate functions (e.g., SUM, COUNT) are applied identically. Ensure calculations (e.g., subtraction, addition) produce the same results.
6. Check for Logical Equivalence in Conditional Expressions: Compare conditional expressions like IIF, CASE WHEN, and IF. Determine if conditions and returned values are logically the same.
7. Assess Ordering of Results: If ORDER BY clause is present, confirm that both queries order results identically. Recognize that differing order may affect equivalence if result order is significant.
8. Generate a New Logical Equivalence Rule (If Applicable): Create an "Equivalent Queries: <query1>
<query2>
Schema Conditions:<conditions>" statement that defines the equivalence. Use GENERALIZED COLUMN and TABLE NAMES. Specify any necessary conditions based on the database schema. Present the rule clearly, indicating both the equivalence and the conditions under which it holds.



Example Equivalence Rules:

<Rule>
Equivalent Queries:
SELECT c1 from t1 WHERE ...;
SELECT c1 FROM t1 WHERE ...;
Schema Conditions:
None.
</Rule>



# Guidelines:
- Make SURE complete to every step PERFECTLY without ANY Mistakes
- Follow the Rules I Gave you and Remember to AVOID generating repeated equivalence rules in the examples I gave you.
- Be sure to format your response like the example equivalence rules I gave you.
- Put <New Rule></New Rule> around the new equivalence rule that you think of. Do not use other formatting around the equivalent queries.
- Use GENERALIZED COLUMN AND TABLE NAMES in any EQUIVALENCE RULE YOU WRITE. DO NOT USE THE SAME NAMES IN THE PROVIDED QUERY PAIRS!!!!
- If the two queries are not logically equivalent, say <New Rule> Not equivalent </New Rule>.
- If the new equivalence rule is already repeated in the examples listed, say <New Rule> Rule exists </New Rule>.
- The new rule should be be MINIMAL to CLEARLY demonstrate the highlighted semantic difference. Use ellipses to shorten SQL queries where necessary to achieve this.

Take a Deep Breath and Carefully Follow the Rules, Guides and Examples I gave you. I will tip you $2000 if you do EVERYTHING Perfectly.

INFO:root:model: gpt-4o
INFO:root:prompt: You are an expert SQL engineer with 20+ years of experience. You will be given some SQL equivalence rules conditional on some database schemas. You will then be given a pair of SQL queries, consisting of a gold query and a machine-generated query, and a database schema that defines the context of the queries. 

Your task is to compare the two provided SQL queries on logical equivalence and generate one more equivalence rule in the same format as the provided example equivalence rules.

Please make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please also keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.



Evaluation Criteria:

Logical equivalence - the alignment between the gold SQL query and the machine-generated SQL query. A machine-generated SQL query is logically equivalent to the gold query if these two queries would RETURN THE SAME RESULTS AND IN THE SAME ORDER for ALL POSSIBLE DATABASE INSTANCES that satisfy the provided database schema for these queries. Annotators were asked to penalize machine-generated queries that overlooked edge cases that the gold queries would have caught otherwise.



Evaluation steps:

1. Understand the Database Schema: Identify all tables used in both queries. List all columns referenced, along with their data types and constraints. Determine primary and foreign key relationships. Note any indexes or unique constraints that may affect query execution.
2. Parse and Break Down Each Query: Identify selected columns, functions, and expressions. Note the tables involved and the join conditions. Understand the filtering conditions applied. Identify grouping and aggregate conditions, if any. Determine if result ordering affects equivalence.
3. Compare Query Components: Check if both queries use the same tables and join conditions. Compare filtering conditions in the WHERE clauses. Assess whether the same columns and expressions are selected. Identify if different functions or syntaxes achieve the same result. Look for logical equivalence in expressions and calculations.
4. Consider Edge Cases and Data Variations: Conceptualize sample datasets that include edge cases (e.g., NULL values, zero values, special characters). Analyze how each query handles these edge cases. Ensure that data type differences do not affect the outcome. Verify that constraints (e.g., NOT NULL, UNIQUE) are accounted for.
5. Evaluate Aggregations and Calculations: Confirm that aggregate functions (e.g., SUM, COUNT) are applied identically. Ensure calculations (e.g., subtraction, addition) produce the same results.
6. Check for Logical Equivalence in Conditional Expressions: Compare conditional expressions like IIF, CASE WHEN, and IF. Determine if conditions and returned values are logically the same.
7. Assess Ordering of Results: If ORDER BY clause is present, confirm that both queries order results identically. Recognize that differing order may affect equivalence if result order is significant.
8. Generate a New Logical Equivalence Rule (If Applicable): Create an "Equivalent Queries: <query1>
<query2>
Schema Conditions:<conditions>" statement that defines the equivalence. Use GENERALIZED COLUMN and TABLE NAMES. Specify any necessary conditions based on the database schema. Present the rule clearly, indicating both the equivalence and the conditions under which it holds.



Example Equivalence Rules:

<Rule>
Equivalent Queries:
SELECT c1 from t1 WHERE ...;
SELECT c1 FROM t1 WHERE ...;
Schema Conditions:
None.
</Rule>



# Guidelines:
- Make SURE complete to every step PERFECTLY without ANY Mistakes
- Follow the Rules I Gave you and Remember to AVOID generating repeated equivalence rules in the examples I gave you.
- Be sure to format your response like the example equivalence rules I gave you.
- Put <New Rule></New Rule> around the new equivalence rule that you think of. Do not use other formatting around the equivalent queries.
- Use GENERALIZED COLUMN AND TABLE NAMES in any EQUIVALENCE RULE YOU WRITE. DO NOT USE THE SAME NAMES IN THE PROVIDED QUERY PAIRS!!!!
- If the two queries are not logically equivalent, say <New Rule> Not equivalent </New Rule>.
- If the new equivalence rule is already repeated in the examples listed, say <New Rule> Rule exists </New Rule>.
- The new rule should be be MINIMAL to CLEARLY demonstrate the highlighted semantic difference. Use ellipses to shorten SQL queries where necessary to achieve this.

Take a Deep Breath and Carefully Follow the Rules, Guides and Examples I gave you. I will tip you $2000 if you do EVERYTHING Perfectly.

INFO:root:model: gpt-4o
INFO:root:prompt: You are an expert SQL engineer with 20+ years of experience. You will be given some SQL equivalence rules conditional on some database schemas. You will then be given a pair of SQL queries, consisting of a gold query and a machine-generated query, and a database schema that defines the context of the queries. 

Your task is to compare the two provided SQL queries on logical equivalence and generate one more equivalence rule in the same format as the provided example equivalence rules.

Please make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please also keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.



Evaluation Criteria:

Logical equivalence - the alignment between the gold SQL query and the machine-generated SQL query. A machine-generated SQL query is logically equivalent to the gold query if these two queries would RETURN THE SAME RESULTS AND IN THE SAME ORDER for ALL POSSIBLE DATABASE INSTANCES that satisfy the provided database schema for these queries. Annotators were asked to penalize machine-generated queries that overlooked edge cases that the gold queries would have caught otherwise.



Evaluation steps:

1. Understand the Database Schema: Identify all tables used in both queries. List all columns referenced, along with their data types and constraints. Determine primary and foreign key relationships. Note any indexes or unique constraints that may affect query execution.
2. Parse and Break Down Each Query: Identify selected columns, functions, and expressions. Note the tables involved and the join conditions. Understand the filtering conditions applied. Identify grouping and aggregate conditions, if any. Determine if result ordering affects equivalence.
3. Compare Query Components: Check if both queries use the same tables and join conditions. Compare filtering conditions in the WHERE clauses. Assess whether the same columns and expressions are selected. Identify if different functions or syntaxes achieve the same result. Look for logical equivalence in expressions and calculations.
4. Consider Edge Cases and Data Variations: Conceptualize sample datasets that include edge cases (e.g., NULL values, zero values, special characters). Analyze how each query handles these edge cases. Ensure that data type differences do not affect the outcome. Verify that constraints (e.g., NOT NULL, UNIQUE) are accounted for.
5. Evaluate Aggregations and Calculations: Confirm that aggregate functions (e.g., SUM, COUNT) are applied identically. Ensure calculations (e.g., subtraction, addition) produce the same results.
6. Check for Logical Equivalence in Conditional Expressions: Compare conditional expressions like IIF, CASE WHEN, and IF. Determine if conditions and returned values are logically the same.
7. Assess Ordering of Results: If ORDER BY clause is present, confirm that both queries order results identically. Recognize that differing order may affect equivalence if result order is significant.
8. Generate a New Logical Equivalence Rule (If Applicable): Create an "Equivalent Queries: <query1>
<query2>
Schema Conditions:<conditions>" statement that defines the equivalence. Use GENERALIZED COLUMN and TABLE NAMES. Specify any necessary conditions based on the database schema. Present the rule clearly, indicating both the equivalence and the conditions under which it holds.



Example Equivalence Rules:

<Rule>
Equivalent Queries:
SELECT c1 from t1 WHERE ...;
SELECT c1 FROM t1 WHERE ...;
Schema Conditions:
None.
</Rule>



# Guidelines:
- Make SURE complete to every step PERFECTLY without ANY Mistakes
- Follow the Rules I Gave you and Remember to AVOID generating repeated equivalence rules in the examples I gave you.
- Be sure to format your response like the example equivalence rules I gave you.
- Put <New Rule></New Rule> around the new equivalence rule that you think of. Do not use other formatting around the equivalent queries.
- Use GENERALIZED COLUMN AND TABLE NAMES in any EQUIVALENCE RULE YOU WRITE. DO NOT USE THE SAME NAMES IN THE PROVIDED QUERY PAIRS!!!!
- If the two queries are not logically equivalent, say <New Rule> Not equivalent </New Rule>.
- If the new equivalence rule is already repeated in the examples listed, say <New Rule> Rule exists </New Rule>.
- The new rule should be be MINIMAL to CLEARLY demonstrate the highlighted semantic difference. Use ellipses to shorten SQL queries where necessary to achieve this.

Take a Deep Breath and Carefully Follow the Rules, Guides and Examples I gave you. I will tip you $2000 if you do EVERYTHING Perfectly.

INFO:root:model: gpt-4o
INFO:root:prompt: You are an expert SQL engineer with 20+ years of experience. You will be given some SQL equivalence rules conditional on some database schemas. You will then be given a pair of SQL queries, consisting of a gold query and a machine-generated query, and a database schema that defines the context of the queries. 

Your task is to compare the two provided SQL queries on logical equivalence and generate one more equivalence rule in the same format as the provided example equivalence rules.

Please make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please also keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.



Evaluation Criteria:

Logical equivalence - the alignment between the gold SQL query and the machine-generated SQL query. A machine-generated SQL query is logically equivalent to the gold query if these two queries would RETURN THE SAME RESULTS AND IN THE SAME ORDER for ALL POSSIBLE DATABASE INSTANCES that satisfy the provided database schema for these queries. Annotators were asked to penalize machine-generated queries that overlooked edge cases that the gold queries would have caught otherwise.



Evaluation steps:

1. Understand the Database Schema: Identify all tables used in both queries. List all columns referenced, along with their data types and constraints. Determine primary and foreign key relationships. Note any indexes or unique constraints that may affect query execution.
2. Parse and Break Down Each Query: Identify selected columns, functions, and expressions. Note the tables involved and the join conditions. Understand the filtering conditions applied. Identify grouping and aggregate conditions, if any. Determine if result ordering affects equivalence.
3. Compare Query Components: Check if both queries use the same tables and join conditions. Compare filtering conditions in the WHERE clauses. Assess whether the same columns and expressions are selected. Identify if different functions or syntaxes achieve the same result. Look for logical equivalence in expressions and calculations.
4. Consider Edge Cases and Data Variations: Conceptualize sample datasets that include edge cases (e.g., NULL values, zero values, special characters). Analyze how each query handles these edge cases. Ensure that data type differences do not affect the outcome. Verify that constraints (e.g., NOT NULL, UNIQUE) are accounted for.
5. Evaluate Aggregations and Calculations: Confirm that aggregate functions (e.g., SUM, COUNT) are applied identically. Ensure calculations (e.g., subtraction, addition) produce the same results.
6. Check for Logical Equivalence in Conditional Expressions: Compare conditional expressions like IIF, CASE WHEN, and IF. Determine if conditions and returned values are logically the same.
7. Assess Ordering of Results: If ORDER BY clause is present, confirm that both queries order results identically. Recognize that differing order may affect equivalence if result order is significant.
8. Generate a New Logical Equivalence Rule (If Applicable): Create an "Equivalent Queries: <query1>
<query2>
Schema Conditions:<conditions>" statement that defines the equivalence. Use GENERALIZED COLUMN and TABLE NAMES. Specify any necessary conditions based on the database schema. Present the rule clearly, indicating both the equivalence and the conditions under which it holds.



Example Equivalence Rules:

<Rule>
Equivalent Queries:
SELECT c1 from t1 WHERE ...;
SELECT c1 FROM t1 WHERE ...;
Schema Conditions:
None.
</Rule>



# Guidelines:
- Make SURE complete to every step PERFECTLY without ANY Mistakes
- Follow the Rules I Gave you and Remember to AVOID generating repeated equivalence rules in the examples I gave you.
- Be sure to format your response like the example equivalence rules I gave you.
- Put <New Rule></New Rule> around the new equivalence rule that you think of. Do not use other formatting around the equivalent queries.
- Use GENERALIZED COLUMN AND TABLE NAMES in any EQUIVALENCE RULE YOU WRITE. DO NOT USE THE SAME NAMES IN THE PROVIDED QUERY PAIRS!!!!
- If the two queries are not logically equivalent, say <New Rule> Not equivalent </New Rule>.
- If the new equivalence rule is already repeated in the examples listed, say <New Rule> Rule exists </New Rule>.
- The new rule should be be MINIMAL to CLEARLY demonstrate the highlighted semantic difference. Use ellipses to shorten SQL queries where necessary to achieve this.

Take a Deep Breath and Carefully Follow the Rules, Guides and Examples I gave you. I will tip you $2000 if you do EVERYTHING Perfectly.



Pair of SQL Queries:
<Gold SQL Query>
SELECT COUNT(T1.Id) FROM users AS T1 INNER JOIN posts AS T2 ON T1.Id = T2.OwnerUserId WHERE T1.Location = 'United Kingdom' AND T2.FavoriteCount >= 4;
</Gold SQL Query>

<Machine-generated SQL Query>
SELECT count(users.id) FROM users INNER JOIN posts ON users.id = posts.owneruserid WHERE users.location = 'United Kingdom' AND posts.favoritecount >= 4;
</Machine-generated SQL Query>

INFO:root:prompt: You are an expert SQL engineer with 20+ years of experience. You will be given some SQL equivalence rules conditional on some database schemas. You will then be given a pair of SQL queries, consisting of a gold query and a machine-generated query, and a database schema that defines the context of the queries. 

Your task is to compare the two provided SQL queries on logical equivalence and generate one more equivalence rule in the same format as the provided example equivalence rules.

Please make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please also keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.



Evaluation Criteria:

Logical equivalence - the alignment between the gold SQL query and the machine-generated SQL query. A machine-generated SQL query is logically equivalent to the gold query if these two queries would RETURN THE SAME RESULTS AND IN THE SAME ORDER for ALL POSSIBLE DATABASE INSTANCES that satisfy the provided database schema for these queries. Annotators were asked to penalize machine-generated queries that overlooked edge cases that the gold queries would have caught otherwise.



Evaluation steps:

1. Understand the Database Schema: Identify all tables used in both queries. List all columns referenced, along with their data types and constraints. Determine primary and foreign key relationships. Note any indexes or unique constraints that may affect query execution.
2. Parse and Break Down Each Query: Identify selected columns, functions, and expressions. Note the tables involved and the join conditions. Understand the filtering conditions applied. Identify grouping and aggregate conditions, if any. Determine if result ordering affects equivalence.
3. Compare Query Components: Check if both queries use the same tables and join conditions. Compare filtering conditions in the WHERE clauses. Assess whether the same columns and expressions are selected. Identify if different functions or syntaxes achieve the same result. Look for logical equivalence in expressions and calculations.
4. Consider Edge Cases and Data Variations: Conceptualize sample datasets that include edge cases (e.g., NULL values, zero values, special characters). Analyze how each query handles these edge cases. Ensure that data type differences do not affect the outcome. Verify that constraints (e.g., NOT NULL, UNIQUE) are accounted for.
5. Evaluate Aggregations and Calculations: Confirm that aggregate functions (e.g., SUM, COUNT) are applied identically. Ensure calculations (e.g., subtraction, addition) produce the same results.
6. Check for Logical Equivalence in Conditional Expressions: Compare conditional expressions like IIF, CASE WHEN, and IF. Determine if conditions and returned values are logically the same.
7. Assess Ordering of Results: If ORDER BY clause is present, confirm that both queries order results identically. Recognize that differing order may affect equivalence if result order is significant.
8. Generate a New Logical Equivalence Rule (If Applicable): Create an "Equivalent Queries: <query1>
<query2>
Schema Conditions:<conditions>" statement that defines the equivalence. Use GENERALIZED COLUMN and TABLE NAMES. Specify any necessary conditions based on the database schema. Present the rule clearly, indicating both the equivalence and the conditions under which it holds.



Example Equivalence Rules:

<Rule>
Equivalent Queries:
SELECT c1 from t1 WHERE ...;
SELECT c1 FROM t1 WHERE ...;
Schema Conditions:
None.
</Rule>



# Guidelines:
- Make SURE complete to every step PERFECTLY without ANY Mistakes
- Follow the Rules I Gave you and Remember to AVOID generating repeated equivalence rules in the examples I gave you.
- Be sure to format your response like the example equivalence rules I gave you.
- Put <New Rule></New Rule> around the new equivalence rule that you think of. Do not use other formatting around the equivalent queries.
- Use GENERALIZED COLUMN AND TABLE NAMES in any EQUIVALENCE RULE YOU WRITE. DO NOT USE THE SAME NAMES IN THE PROVIDED QUERY PAIRS!!!!
- If the two queries are not logically equivalent, say <New Rule> Not equivalent </New Rule>.
- If the new equivalence rule is already repeated in the examples listed, say <New Rule> Rule exists </New Rule>.
- The new rule should be be MINIMAL to CLEARLY demonstrate the highlighted semantic difference. Use ellipses to shorten SQL queries where necessary to achieve this.

Take a Deep Breath and Carefully Follow the Rules, Guides and Examples I gave you. I will tip you $2000 if you do EVERYTHING Perfectly.



Pair of SQL Queries:
<Gold SQL Query>
SELECT T2.Id, T2.Title FROM users AS T1 INNER JOIN posts AS T2 ON T1.Id = T2.OwnerUserId WHERE T1.DisplayName = 'Harvey Motulsky' ORDER BY T2.ViewCount DESC LIMIT 1;
</Gold SQL Query>

<Machine-generated SQL Query>
SELECT posts.id, posts.title FROM users INNER JOIN posts ON users.id = posts.owneruserid WHERE users.displayname = 'Harvey Motulsky' ORDER BY posts.viewcount DESC LIMIT 1;
</Machine-generated SQL Query>

Assess whether the same columns and expressions are selected. Identify if different functions or syntaxes achieve the same result. Look for logical equivalence in expressions and calculations.
4. Consider Edge Cases and Data Variations: Conceptualize sample datasets that include edge cases (e.g., NULL values, zero values, special characters). Analyze how each query handles these edge cases. Ensure that data type differences do not affect the outcome. Verify that constraints (e.g., NOT NULL, UNIQUE) are accounted for.
5. Evaluate Aggregations and Calculations: Confirm that aggregate functions (e.g., SUM, COUNT) are applied identically. Ensure calculations (e.g., subtraction, addition) produce the same results.
6. Check for Logical Equivalence in Conditional Expressions: Compare conditional expressions like IIF, CASE WHEN, and IF. Determine if conditions and returned values are logically the same.
7. Assess Ordering of Results: If ORDER BY clause is present, confirm that both queries order results identically. Recognize that differing order may affect equivalence if result order is significant.
8. Generate a New Logical Equivalence Rule (If Applicable): Create an "Equivalent Queries: <query1>
<query2>
Schema Conditions:<conditions>" statement that defines the equivalence. Use GENERALIZED COLUMN and TABLE NAMES. Specify any necessary conditions based on the database schema. Present the rule clearly, indicating both the equivalence and the conditions under which it holds.



Example Equivalence Rules:

<Rule>
Equivalent Queries:
SELECT c1 from t1 WHERE ...;
SELECT c1 FROM t1 WHERE ...;
Schema Conditions:
None.
</Rule>



# Guidelines:
- Make SURE complete to every step PERFECTLY without ANY Mistakes
- Follow the Rules I Gave you and Remember to AVOID generating repeated equivalence rules in the examples I gave you.
- Be sure to format your response like the example equivalence rules I gave you.
- Put <New Rule></New Rule> around the new equivalence rule that you think of. Do not use other formatting around the equivalent queries.
- Use GENERALIZED COLUMN AND TABLE NAMES in any EQUIVALENCE RULE YOU WRITE. DO NOT USE THE SAME NAMES IN THE PROVIDED QUERY PAIRS!!!!
- If the two queries are not logically equivalent, say <New Rule> Not equivalent </New Rule>.
- If the new equivalence rule is already repeated in the examples listed, say <New Rule> Rule exists </New Rule>.
- The new rule should be be MINIMAL to CLEARLY demonstrate the highlighted semantic difference. Use ellipses to shorten SQL queries where necessary to achieve this.

Take a Deep Breath and Carefully Follow the Rules, Guides and Examples I gave you. I will tip you $2000 if you do EVERYTHING Perfectly.

INFO:root:model: gpt-4o
INFO:root:prompt: You are an expert SQL engineer with 20+ years of experience. You will be given some SQL equivalence rules conditional on some database schemas. You will then be given a pair of SQL queries, consisting of a gold query and a machine-generated query, and a database schema that defines the context of the queries. 

Your task is to compare the two provided SQL queries on logical equivalence and generate one more equivalence rule in the same format as the provided example equivalence rules.

Please make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please also keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.



Evaluation Criteria:

Logical equivalence - the alignment between the gold SQL query and the machine-generated SQL query. A machine-generated SQL query is logically equivalent to the gold query if these two queries would RETURN THE SAME RESULTS AND IN THE SAME ORDER for ALL POSSIBLE DATABASE INSTANCES that satisfy the provided database schema for these queries. Annotators were asked to penalize machine-generated queries that overlooked edge cases that the gold queries would have caught otherwise.



Evaluation steps:

1. Understand the Database Schema: Identify all tables used in both queries. List all columns referenced, along with their data types and constraints. Determine primary and foreign key relationships. Note any indexes or unique constraints that may affect query execution.
2. Parse and Break Down Each Query: Identify selected columns, functions, and expressions. Note the tables involved and the join conditions. Understand the filtering conditions applied. Identify grouping and aggregate conditions, if any. Determine if result ordering affects equivalence.
3. Compare Query Components: Check if both queries use the same tables and join conditions. Compare filtering conditions in the WHERE clauses. Assess whether the same columns and expressions are selected. Identify if different functions or syntaxes achieve the same result. Look for logical equivalence in expressions and calculations.
4. Consider Edge Cases and Data Variations: Conceptualize sample datasets that include edge cases (e.g., NULL values, zero values, special characters). Analyze how each query handles these edge cases. Ensure that data type differences do not affect the outcome. Verify that constraints (e.g., NOT NULL, UNIQUE) are accounted for.
5. Evaluate Aggregations and Calculations: Confirm that aggregate functions (e.g., SUM, COUNT) are applied identically. Ensure calculations (e.g., subtraction, addition) produce the same results.
6. Check for Logical Equivalence in Conditional Expressions: Compare conditional expressions like IIF, CASE WHEN, and IF. Determine if conditions and returned values are logically the same.
7. Assess Ordering of Results: If ORDER BY clause is present, confirm that both queries order results identically. Recognize that differing order may affect equivalence if result order is significant.
8. Generate a New Logical Equivalence Rule (If Applicable): Create an "Equivalent Queries: <query1>
<query2>
Schema Conditions:<conditions>" statement that defines the equivalence. Use GENERALIZED COLUMN and TABLE NAMES. Specify any necessary conditions based on the database schema. Present the rule clearly, indicating both the equivalence and the conditions under which it holds.



Example Equivalence Rules:

<Rule>
Equivalent Queries:
SELECT c1 from t1 WHERE ...;
SELECT c1 FROM t1 WHERE ...;
Schema Conditions:
None.
</Rule>



# Guidelines:
- Make SURE complete to every step PERFECTLY without ANY Mistakes
- Follow the Rules I Gave you and Remember to AVOID generating repeated equivalence rules in the examples I gave you.
- Be sure to format your response like the example equivalence rules I gave you.
- Put <New Rule></New Rule> around the new equivalence rule that you think of. Do not use other formatting around the equivalent queries.
- Use GENERALIZED COLUMN AND TABLE NAMES in any EQUIVALENCE RULE YOU WRITE. DO NOT USE THE SAME NAMES IN THE PROVIDED QUERY PAIRS!!!!
- If the two queries are not logically equivalent, say <New Rule> Not equivalent </New Rule>.
- If the new equivalence rule is already repeated in the examples listed, say <New Rule> Rule exists </New Rule>.
- The new rule should be be MINIMAL to CLEARLY demonstrate the highlighted semantic difference. Use ellipses to shorten SQL queries where necessary to achieve this.

Take a Deep Breath and Carefully Follow the Rules, Guides and Examples I gave you. I will tip you $2000 if you do EVERYTHING Perfectly.

LIMIT 1` in the machine-generated query, which selects the first user with the maximum reputation.\n\n### Step 5: Evaluate Aggregations and Calculations\n- Both queries perform identical calculations for the percentage.\n\n### Step 6: Check for Logical Equivalence in Conditional Expressions\n- The conditional expressions in the `CASE` statements are logically equivalent.\n\n### Step 7: Assess Ordering of Results\n- Neither query specifies an `ORDER BY` clause for the final result, so ordering is not a factor.\n\n### Conclusion\nBoth queries are logically equivalent, as they compute the same result for all possible database instances that satisfy the schema.\n\n### Step 8: Generate a New Logical Equivalence Rule\n\n<New Rule>\nEquivalent Queries:\nSELECT CAST(SUM(CASE WHEN c1 > 50 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS REAL) * 100 / COUNT(t1.c2) FROM t1 INNER JOIN t2 ON t1.c2 = t2.c3 INNER JOIN (SELECT MAX(c4) AS max_c4 FROM t1) t3 ON t1.c4 = t3.max_c4;\nSELECT cast(sum(CASE WHEN c1 > 50 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS REAL) * 100 / count(c2) FROM t2 WHERE c3 = (SELECT c2 FROM t1 ORDER BY c4 DESC LIMIT 1);\nSchema Conditions:\nt2.c3 is a foreign key referencing t1.c2.\n", role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None, refusal=None))], created=1732079778, model='gpt-4o-2024-08-06', object='chat.completion', system_fingerprint='fp_831e067d82', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=784, prompt_tokens=1985, total_tokens=2769, prompt_tokens_details={'cached_tokens': 0, 'audio_tokens': 0}, completion_tokens_details={'reasoning_tokens': 0, 'audio_tokens': 0, 'accepted_prediction_tokens': 0, 'rejected_prediction_tokens': 0}))

INFO:root:model: gpt-4o
INFO:root:prompt: You are an expert SQL engineer with 20+ years of experience. You will be given some SQL equivalence rules conditional on some database schemas. You will then be given a pair of SQL queries, consisting of a gold query and a machine-generated query, and a database schema that defines the context of the queries. 

Your task is to compare the two provided SQL queries on logical equivalence and generate one more equivalence rule in the same format as the provided example equivalence rules.

Please make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please also keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.



Evaluation Criteria:

Logical equivalence - the alignment between the gold SQL query and the machine-generated SQL query. A machine-generated SQL query is logically equivalent to the gold query if these two queries would RETURN THE SAME RESULTS AND IN THE SAME ORDER for ALL POSSIBLE DATABASE INSTANCES that satisfy the provided database schema for these queries. Annotators were asked to penalize machine-generated queries that overlooked edge cases that the gold queries would have caught otherwise.



Evaluation steps:

1. Understand the Database Schema: Identify all tables used in both queries. List all columns referenced, along with their data types and constraints. Determine primary and foreign key relationships. Note any indexes or unique constraints that may affect query execution.
2. Parse and Break Down Each Query: Identify selected columns, functions, and expressions. Note the tables involved and the join conditions. Understand the filtering conditions applied. Identify grouping and aggregate conditions, if any. Determine if result ordering affects equivalence.
3. Compare Query Components: Check if both queries use the same tables and join conditions. Compare filtering conditions in the WHERE clauses. Assess whether the same columns and expressions are selected. Identify if different functions or syntaxes achieve the same result. Look for logical equivalence in expressions and calculations.
4. Consider Edge Cases and Data Variations: Conceptualize sample datasets that include edge cases (e.g., NULL values, zero values, special characters). Analyze how each query handles these edge cases. Ensure that data type differences do not affect the outcome. Verify that constraints (e.g., NOT NULL, UNIQUE) are accounted for.
5. Evaluate Aggregations and Calculations: Confirm that aggregate functions (e.g., SUM, COUNT) are applied identically. Ensure calculations (e.g., subtraction, addition) produce the same results.
6. Check for Logical Equivalence in Conditional Expressions: Compare conditional expressions like IIF, CASE WHEN, and IF. Determine if conditions and returned values are logically the same.
7. Assess Ordering of Results: If ORDER BY clause is present, confirm that both queries order results identically. Recognize that differing order may affect equivalence if result order is significant.
8. Generate a New Logical Equivalence Rule (If Applicable): Create an "Equivalent Queries: <query1>
<query2>
Schema Conditions:<conditions>" statement that defines the equivalence. Use GENERALIZED COLUMN and TABLE NAMES. Specify any necessary conditions based on the database schema. Present the rule clearly, indicating both the equivalence and the conditions under which it holds.



Example Equivalence Rules:

<Rule>
Equivalent Queries:
SELECT c1 from t1 WHERE ...;
SELECT c1 FROM t1 WHERE ...;
Schema Conditions:
None.
</Rule>



# Guidelines:
- Make SURE complete to every step PERFECTLY without ANY Mistakes
- Follow the Rules I Gave you and Remember to AVOID generating repeated equivalence rules in the examples I gave you.
- Be sure to format your response like the example equivalence rules I gave you.
- Put <New Rule></New Rule> around the new equivalence rule that you think of. Do not use other formatting around the equivalent queries.
- Use GENERALIZED COLUMN AND TABLE NAMES in any EQUIVALENCE RULE YOU WRITE. DO NOT USE THE SAME NAMES IN THE PROVIDED QUERY PAIRS!!!!
- If the two queries are not logically equivalent, say <New Rule> Not equivalent </New Rule>.
- If the new equivalence rule is already repeated in the examples listed, say <New Rule> Rule exists </New Rule>.
- The new rule should be be MINIMAL to CLEARLY demonstrate the highlighted semantic difference. Use ellipses to shorten SQL queries where necessary to achieve this.

Take a Deep Breath and Carefully Follow the Rules, Guides and Examples I gave you. I will tip you $2000 if you do EVERYTHING Perfectly.

INFO:root:model: gpt-4o
INFO:root:prompt: You are an expert SQL engineer with 20+ years of experience. You will be given some SQL equivalence rules conditional on some database schemas. You will then be given a pair of SQL queries, consisting of a gold query and a machine-generated query, and a database schema that defines the context of the queries. 

Your task is to compare the two provided SQL queries on logical equivalence and generate one more equivalence rule in the same format as the provided example equivalence rules.

Please make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please also keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.



Evaluation Criteria:

Logical equivalence - the alignment between the gold SQL query and the machine-generated SQL query. A machine-generated SQL query is logically equivalent to the gold query if these two queries would RETURN THE SAME RESULTS AND IN THE SAME ORDER for ALL POSSIBLE DATABASE INSTANCES that satisfy the provided database schema for these queries. Annotators were asked to penalize machine-generated queries that overlooked edge cases that the gold queries would have caught otherwise.



Evaluation steps:

1. Understand the Database Schema: Identify all tables used in both queries. List all columns referenced, along with their data types and constraints. Determine primary and foreign key relationships. Note any indexes or unique constraints that may affect query execution.
2. Parse and Break Down Each Query: Identify selected columns, functions, and expressions. Note the tables involved and the join conditions. Understand the filtering conditions applied. Identify grouping and aggregate conditions, if any. Determine if result ordering affects equivalence.
3. Compare Query Components: Check if both queries use the same tables and join conditions. Compare filtering conditions in the WHERE clauses. Assess whether the same columns and expressions are selected. Identify if different functions or syntaxes achieve the same result. Look for logical equivalence in expressions and calculations.
4. Consider Edge Cases and Data Variations: Conceptualize sample datasets that include edge cases (e.g., NULL values, zero values, special characters). Analyze how each query handles these edge cases. Ensure that data type differences do not affect the outcome. Verify that constraints (e.g., NOT NULL, UNIQUE) are accounted for.
5. Evaluate Aggregations and Calculations: Confirm that aggregate functions (e.g., SUM, COUNT) are applied identically. Ensure calculations (e.g., subtraction, addition) produce the same results.
6. Check for Logical Equivalence in Conditional Expressions: Compare conditional expressions like IIF, CASE WHEN, and IF. Determine if conditions and returned values are logically the same.
7. Assess Ordering of Results: If ORDER BY clause is present, confirm that both queries order results identically. Recognize that differing order may affect equivalence if result order is significant.
8. Generate a New Logical Equivalence Rule (If Applicable): Create an "Equivalent Queries: <query1>
<query2>
Schema Conditions:<conditions>" statement that defines the equivalence. Use GENERALIZED COLUMN and TABLE NAMES. Specify any necessary conditions based on the database schema. Present the rule clearly, indicating both the equivalence and the conditions under which it holds.



Example Equivalence Rules:

<Rule>
Equivalent Queries:
SELECT c1 from t1 WHERE ...;
SELECT c1 FROM t1 WHERE ...;
Schema Conditions:
None.
</Rule>



# Guidelines:
- Make SURE complete to every step PERFECTLY without ANY Mistakes
- Follow the Rules I Gave you and Remember to AVOID generating repeated equivalence rules in the examples I gave you.
- Be sure to format your response like the example equivalence rules I gave you.
- Put <New Rule></New Rule> around the new equivalence rule that you think of. Do not use other formatting around the equivalent queries.
- Use GENERALIZED COLUMN AND TABLE NAMES in any EQUIVALENCE RULE YOU WRITE. DO NOT USE THE SAME NAMES IN THE PROVIDED QUERY PAIRS!!!!
- If the two queries are not logically equivalent, say <New Rule> Not equivalent </New Rule>.
- If the new equivalence rule is already repeated in the examples listed, say <New Rule> Rule exists </New Rule>.
- The new rule should be be MINIMAL to CLEARLY demonstrate the highlighted semantic difference. Use ellipses to shorten SQL queries where necessary to achieve this.

Take a Deep Breath and Carefully Follow the Rules, Guides and Examples I gave you. I will tip you $2000 if you do EVERYTHING Perfectly.

INFO:root:model: gpt-4o
INFO:root:prompt: You are an expert SQL engineer with 20+ years of experience. You will be given some SQL equivalence rules conditional on some database schemas. You will then be given a pair of SQL queries, consisting of a gold query and a machine-generated query, and a database schema that defines the context of the queries. 

Your task is to compare the two provided SQL queries on logical equivalence and generate one more equivalence rule in the same format as the provided example equivalence rules.

Please make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please also keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.



Evaluation Criteria:

Logical equivalence - the alignment between the gold SQL query and the machine-generated SQL query. A machine-generated SQL query is logically equivalent to the gold query if these two queries would RETURN THE SAME RESULTS AND IN THE SAME ORDER for ALL POSSIBLE DATABASE INSTANCES that satisfy the provided database schema for these queries. Annotators were asked to penalize machine-generated queries that overlooked edge cases that the gold queries would have caught otherwise.



Evaluation steps:

1. Understand the Database Schema: Identify all tables used in both queries. List all columns referenced, along with their data types and constraints. Determine primary and foreign key relationships. Note any indexes or unique constraints that may affect query execution.
2. Parse and Break Down Each Query: Identify selected columns, functions, and expressions. Note the tables involved and the join conditions. Understand the filtering conditions applied. Identify grouping and aggregate conditions, if any. Determine if result ordering affects equivalence.
3. Compare Query Components: Check if both queries use the same tables and join conditions. Compare filtering conditions in the WHERE clauses. Assess whether the same columns and expressions are selected. Identify if different functions or syntaxes achieve the same result. Look for logical equivalence in expressions and calculations.
4. Consider Edge Cases and Data Variations: Conceptualize sample datasets that include edge cases (e.g., NULL values, zero values, special characters). Analyze how each query handles these edge cases. Ensure that data type differences do not affect the outcome. Verify that constraints (e.g., NOT NULL, UNIQUE) are accounted for.
5. Evaluate Aggregations and Calculations: Confirm that aggregate functions (e.g., SUM, COUNT) are applied identically. Ensure calculations (e.g., subtraction, addition) produce the same results.
6. Check for Logical Equivalence in Conditional Expressions: Compare conditional expressions like IIF, CASE WHEN, and IF. Determine if conditions and returned values are logically the same.
7. Assess Ordering of Results: If ORDER BY clause is present, confirm that both queries order results identically. Recognize that differing order may affect equivalence if result order is significant.
8. Generate a New Logical Equivalence Rule (If Applicable): Create an "Equivalent Queries: <query1>
<query2>
Schema Conditions:<conditions>" statement that defines the equivalence. Use GENERALIZED COLUMN and TABLE NAMES. Specify any necessary conditions based on the database schema. Present the rule clearly, indicating both the equivalence and the conditions under which it holds.



Example Equivalence Rules:

<Rule>
Equivalent Queries:
SELECT c1 from t1 WHERE ...;
SELECT c1 FROM t1 WHERE ...;
Schema Conditions:
None.
</Rule>



# Guidelines:
- Make SURE complete to every step PERFECTLY without ANY Mistakes
- Follow the Rules I Gave you and Remember to AVOID generating repeated equivalence rules in the examples I gave you.
- Be sure to format your response like the example equivalence rules I gave you.
- Put <New Rule></New Rule> around the new equivalence rule that you think of. Do not use other formatting around the equivalent queries.
- Use GENERALIZED COLUMN AND TABLE NAMES in any EQUIVALENCE RULE YOU WRITE. DO NOT USE THE SAME NAMES IN THE PROVIDED QUERY PAIRS!!!!
- If the two queries are not logically equivalent, say <New Rule> Not equivalent </New Rule>.
- If the new equivalence rule is already repeated in the examples listed, say <New Rule> Rule exists </New Rule>.
- The new rule should be be MINIMAL to CLEARLY demonstrate the highlighted semantic difference. Use ellipses to shorten SQL queries where necessary to achieve this.

Take a Deep Breath and Carefully Follow the Rules, Guides and Examples I gave you. I will tip you $2000 if you do EVERYTHING Perfectly.

INFO:root:model: gpt-4o
INFO:root:prompt: You are an expert SQL engineer with 20+ years of experience. You will be given some SQL equivalence rules conditional on some database schemas. You will then be given a pair of SQL queries, consisting of a gold query and a machine-generated query, and a database schema that defines the context of the queries. 

Your task is to compare the two provided SQL queries on logical equivalence and generate one more equivalence rule in the same format as the provided example equivalence rules.

Please make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please also keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.



Evaluation Criteria:

Logical equivalence - the alignment between the gold SQL query and the machine-generated SQL query. A machine-generated SQL query is logically equivalent to the gold query if these two queries would RETURN THE SAME RESULTS AND IN THE SAME ORDER for ALL POSSIBLE DATABASE INSTANCES that satisfy the provided database schema for these queries. Annotators were asked to penalize machine-generated queries that overlooked edge cases that the gold queries would have caught otherwise.



Evaluation steps:

1. Understand the Database Schema: Identify all tables used in both queries. List all columns referenced, along with their data types and constraints. Determine primary and foreign key relationships. Note any indexes or unique constraints that may affect query execution.
2. Parse and Break Down Each Query: Identify selected columns, functions, and expressions. Note the tables involved and the join conditions. Understand the filtering conditions applied. Identify grouping and aggregate conditions, if any. Determine if result ordering affects equivalence.
3. Compare Query Components: Check if both queries use the same tables and join conditions. Compare filtering conditions in the WHERE clauses. Assess whether the same columns and expressions are selected. Identify if different functions or syntaxes achieve the same result. Look for logical equivalence in expressions and calculations.
4. Consider Edge Cases and Data Variations: Conceptualize sample datasets that include edge cases (e.g., NULL values, zero values, special characters). Analyze how each query handles these edge cases. Ensure that data type differences do not affect the outcome. Verify that constraints (e.g., NOT NULL, UNIQUE) are accounted for.
5. Evaluate Aggregations and Calculations: Confirm that aggregate functions (e.g., SUM, COUNT) are applied identically. Ensure calculations (e.g., subtraction, addition) produce the same results.
6. Check for Logical Equivalence in Conditional Expressions: Compare conditional expressions like IIF, CASE WHEN, and IF. Determine if conditions and returned values are logically the same.
7. Assess Ordering of Results: If ORDER BY clause is present, confirm that both queries order results identically. Recognize that differing order may affect equivalence if result order is significant.
8. Generate a New Logical Equivalence Rule (If Applicable): Create an "Equivalent Queries: <query1>
<query2>
Schema Conditions:<conditions>" statement that defines the equivalence. Use GENERALIZED COLUMN and TABLE NAMES. Specify any necessary conditions based on the database schema. Present the rule clearly, indicating both the equivalence and the conditions under which it holds.



Example Equivalence Rules:

<Rule>
Equivalent Queries:
SELECT c1 from t1 WHERE ...;
SELECT c1 FROM t1 WHERE ...;
Schema Conditions:
None.
</Rule>



# Guidelines:
- Make SURE complete to every step PERFECTLY without ANY Mistakes
- Follow the Rules I Gave you and Remember to AVOID generating repeated equivalence rules in the examples I gave you.
- Be sure to format your response like the example equivalence rules I gave you.
- Put <New Rule></New Rule> around the new equivalence rule that you think of. Do not use other formatting around the equivalent queries.
- Use GENERALIZED COLUMN AND TABLE NAMES in any EQUIVALENCE RULE YOU WRITE. DO NOT USE THE SAME NAMES IN THE PROVIDED QUERY PAIRS!!!!
- If the two queries are not logically equivalent, say <New Rule> Not equivalent </New Rule>.
- If the new equivalence rule is already repeated in the examples listed, say <New Rule> Rule exists </New Rule>.
- The new rule should be be MINIMAL to CLEARLY demonstrate the highlighted semantic difference. Use ellipses to shorten SQL queries where necessary to achieve this.

Take a Deep Breath and Carefully Follow the Rules, Guides and Examples I gave you. I will tip you $2000 if you do EVERYTHING Perfectly.

</Gold SQL Query>

INFO:root:prompt: You are an expert SQL engineer with 20+ years of experience. You will be given some SQL equivalence rules conditional on some database schemas. You will then be given a pair of SQL queries, consisting of a gold query and a machine-generated query, and a database schema that defines the context of the queries. 

Your task is to compare the two provided SQL queries on logical equivalence and generate one more equivalence rule in the same format as the provided example equivalence rules.

Please make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please also keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.



Evaluation Criteria:

Logical equivalence - the alignment between the gold SQL query and the machine-generated SQL query. A machine-generated SQL query is logically equivalent to the gold query if these two queries would RETURN THE SAME RESULTS AND IN THE SAME ORDER for ALL POSSIBLE DATABASE INSTANCES that satisfy the provided database schema for these queries. Annotators were asked to penalize machine-generated queries that overlooked edge cases that the gold queries would have caught otherwise.



Evaluation steps:

1. Understand the Database Schema: Identify all tables used in both queries. List all columns referenced, along with their data types and constraints. Determine primary and foreign key relationships. Note any indexes or unique constraints that may affect query execution.
2. Parse and Break Down Each Query: Identify selected columns, functions, and expressions. Note the tables involved and the join conditions. Understand the filtering conditions applied. Identify grouping and aggregate conditions, if any. Determine if result ordering affects equivalence.
3. Compare Query Components: Check if both queries use the same tables and join conditions. Compare filtering conditions in the WHERE clauses. Assess whether the same columns and expressions are selected. Identify if different functions or syntaxes achieve the same result. Look for logical equivalence in expressions and calculations.
4. Consider Edge Cases and Data Variations: Conceptualize sample datasets that include edge cases (e.g., NULL values, zero values, special characters). Analyze how each query handles these edge cases. Ensure that data type differences do not affect the outcome. Verify that constraints (e.g., NOT NULL, UNIQUE) are accounted for.
5. Evaluate Aggregations and Calculations: Confirm that aggregate functions (e.g., SUM, COUNT) are applied identically. Ensure calculations (e.g., subtraction, addition) produce the same results.
6. Check for Logical Equivalence in Conditional Expressions: Compare conditional expressions like IIF, CASE WHEN, and IF. Determine if conditions and returned values are logically the same.
7. Assess Ordering of Results: If ORDER BY clause is present, confirm that both queries order results identically. Recognize that differing order may affect equivalence if result order is significant.
8. Generate a New Logical Equivalence Rule (If Applicable): Create an "Equivalent Queries: <query1>
<query2>
Schema Conditions:<conditions>" statement that defines the equivalence. Use GENERALIZED COLUMN and TABLE NAMES. Specify any necessary conditions based on the database schema. Present the rule clearly, indicating both the equivalence and the conditions under which it holds.



Example Equivalence Rules:

<Rule>
Equivalent Queries:
SELECT c1 from t1 WHERE ...;
SELECT c1 FROM t1 WHERE ...;
Schema Conditions:
None.
</Rule>



# Guidelines:
- Make SURE complete to every step PERFECTLY without ANY Mistakes
- Follow the Rules I Gave you and Remember to AVOID generating repeated equivalence rules in the examples I gave you.
- Be sure to format your response like the example equivalence rules I gave you.
- Put <New Rule></New Rule> around the new equivalence rule that you think of. Do not use other formatting around the equivalent queries.
- Use GENERALIZED COLUMN AND TABLE NAMES in any EQUIVALENCE RULE YOU WRITE. DO NOT USE THE SAME NAMES IN THE PROVIDED QUERY PAIRS!!!!
- If the two queries are not logically equivalent, say <New Rule> Not equivalent </New Rule>.
- If the new equivalence rule is already repeated in the examples listed, say <New Rule> Rule exists </New Rule>.
- The new rule should be be MINIMAL to CLEARLY demonstrate the highlighted semantic difference. Use ellipses to shorten SQL queries where necessary to achieve this.

Take a Deep Breath and Carefully Follow the Rules, Guides and Examples I gave you. I will tip you $2000 if you do EVERYTHING Perfectly.



Pair of SQL Queries:
<Gold SQL Query>
SELECT CAST(SUM(CASE WHEN borderColor = 'borderless' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS REAL) * 100 / COUNT(id) FROM cards;

INFO:root:model: gpt-4o
INFO:root:prompt: You are an expert SQL engineer with 20+ years of experience. You will be given some SQL equivalence rules conditional on some database schemas. You will then be given a pair of SQL queries, consisting of a gold query and a machine-generated query, and a database schema that defines the context of the queries. 

Your task is to compare the two provided SQL queries on logical equivalence and generate one more equivalence rule in the same format as the provided example equivalence rules.

Please make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please also keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.



Evaluation Criteria:

Logical equivalence - the alignment between the gold SQL query and the machine-generated SQL query. A machine-generated SQL query is logically equivalent to the gold query if these two queries would RETURN THE SAME RESULTS AND IN THE SAME ORDER for ALL POSSIBLE DATABASE INSTANCES that satisfy the provided database schema for these queries. Annotators were asked to penalize machine-generated queries that overlooked edge cases that the gold queries would have caught otherwise.



Evaluation steps:

1. Understand the Database Schema: Identify all tables used in both queries. List all columns referenced, along with their data types and constraints. Determine primary and foreign key relationships. Note any indexes or unique constraints that may affect query execution.
2. Parse and Break Down Each Query: Identify selected columns, functions, and expressions. Note the tables involved and the join conditions. Understand the filtering conditions applied. Identify grouping and aggregate conditions, if any. Determine if result ordering affects equivalence.
3. Compare Query Components: Check if both queries use the same tables and join conditions. Compare filtering conditions in the WHERE clauses. Assess whether the same columns and expressions are selected. Identify if different functions or syntaxes achieve the same result. Look for logical equivalence in expressions and calculations.
4. Consider Edge Cases and Data Variations: Conceptualize sample datasets that include edge cases (e.g., NULL values, zero values, special characters). Analyze how each query handles these edge cases. Ensure that data type differences do not affect the outcome. Verify that constraints (e.g., NOT NULL, UNIQUE) are accounted for.
5. Evaluate Aggregations and Calculations: Confirm that aggregate functions (e.g., SUM, COUNT) are applied identically. Ensure calculations (e.g., subtraction, addition) produce the same results.
6. Check for Logical Equivalence in Conditional Expressions: Compare conditional expressions like IIF, CASE WHEN, and IF. Determine if conditions and returned values are logically the same.
7. Assess Ordering of Results: If ORDER BY clause is present, confirm that both queries order results identically. Recognize that differing order may affect equivalence if result order is significant.
8. Generate a New Logical Equivalence Rule (If Applicable): Create an "Equivalent Queries: <query1>
<query2>
Schema Conditions:<conditions>" statement that defines the equivalence. Use GENERALIZED COLUMN and TABLE NAMES. Specify any necessary conditions based on the database schema. Present the rule clearly, indicating both the equivalence and the conditions under which it holds.



Example Equivalence Rules:

<Rule>
Equivalent Queries:
SELECT c1 from t1 WHERE ...;
SELECT c1 FROM t1 WHERE ...;
Schema Conditions:
None.
</Rule>



# Guidelines:
- Make SURE complete to every step PERFECTLY without ANY Mistakes
- Follow the Rules I Gave you and Remember to AVOID generating repeated equivalence rules in the examples I gave you.
- Be sure to format your response like the example equivalence rules I gave you.
- Put <New Rule></New Rule> around the new equivalence rule that you think of. Do not use other formatting around the equivalent queries.
- Use GENERALIZED COLUMN AND TABLE NAMES in any EQUIVALENCE RULE YOU WRITE. DO NOT USE THE SAME NAMES IN THE PROVIDED QUERY PAIRS!!!!
- If the two queries are not logically equivalent, say <New Rule> Not equivalent </New Rule>.
- If the new equivalence rule is already repeated in the examples listed, say <New Rule> Rule exists </New Rule>.
- The new rule should be be MINIMAL to CLEARLY demonstrate the highlighted semantic difference. Use ellipses to shorten SQL queries where necessary to achieve this.

Take a Deep Breath and Carefully Follow the Rules, Guides and Examples I gave you. I will tip you $2000 if you do EVERYTHING Perfectly.

INFO:root:model: gpt-4o
INFO:root:prompt: You are an expert SQL engineer with 20+ years of experience. You will be given some SQL equivalence rules conditional on some database schemas. You will then be given a pair of SQL queries, consisting of a gold query and a machine-generated query, and a database schema that defines the context of the queries. 

Your task is to compare the two provided SQL queries on logical equivalence and generate one more equivalence rule in the same format as the provided example equivalence rules.

Please make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please also keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.



Evaluation Criteria:

Logical equivalence - the alignment between the gold SQL query and the machine-generated SQL query. A machine-generated SQL query is logically equivalent to the gold query if these two queries would RETURN THE SAME RESULTS AND IN THE SAME ORDER for ALL POSSIBLE DATABASE INSTANCES that satisfy the provided database schema for these queries. Annotators were asked to penalize machine-generated queries that overlooked edge cases that the gold queries would have caught otherwise.



Evaluation steps:

1. Understand the Database Schema: Identify all tables used in both queries. List all columns referenced, along with their data types and constraints. Determine primary and foreign key relationships. Note any indexes or unique constraints that may affect query execution.
2. Parse and Break Down Each Query: Identify selected columns, functions, and expressions. Note the tables involved and the join conditions. Understand the filtering conditions applied. Identify grouping and aggregate conditions, if any. Determine if result ordering affects equivalence.
3. Compare Query Components: Check if both queries use the same tables and join conditions. Compare filtering conditions in the WHERE clauses. Assess whether the same columns and expressions are selected. Identify if different functions or syntaxes achieve the same result. Look for logical equivalence in expressions and calculations.
4. Consider Edge Cases and Data Variations: Conceptualize sample datasets that include edge cases (e.g., NULL values, zero values, special characters). Analyze how each query handles these edge cases. Ensure that data type differences do not affect the outcome. Verify that constraints (e.g., NOT NULL, UNIQUE) are accounted for.
5. Evaluate Aggregations and Calculations: Confirm that aggregate functions (e.g., SUM, COUNT) are applied identically. Ensure calculations (e.g., subtraction, addition) produce the same results.
6. Check for Logical Equivalence in Conditional Expressions: Compare conditional expressions like IIF, CASE WHEN, and IF. Determine if conditions and returned values are logically the same.
7. Assess Ordering of Results: If ORDER BY clause is present, confirm that both queries order results identically. Recognize that differing order may affect equivalence if result order is significant.
8. Generate a New Logical Equivalence Rule (If Applicable): Create an "Equivalent Queries: <query1>
<query2>
Schema Conditions:<conditions>" statement that defines the equivalence. Use GENERALIZED COLUMN and TABLE NAMES. Specify any necessary conditions based on the database schema. Present the rule clearly, indicating both the equivalence and the conditions under which it holds.



Example Equivalence Rules:

<Rule>
Equivalent Queries:
SELECT c1 from t1 WHERE ...;
SELECT c1 FROM t1 WHERE ...;
Schema Conditions:
None.
</Rule>



# Guidelines:
- Make SURE complete to every step PERFECTLY without ANY Mistakes
- Follow the Rules I Gave you and Remember to AVOID generating repeated equivalence rules in the examples I gave you.
- Be sure to format your response like the example equivalence rules I gave you.
- Put <New Rule></New Rule> around the new equivalence rule that you think of. Do not use other formatting around the equivalent queries.
- Use GENERALIZED COLUMN AND TABLE NAMES in any EQUIVALENCE RULE YOU WRITE. DO NOT USE THE SAME NAMES IN THE PROVIDED QUERY PAIRS!!!!
- If the two queries are not logically equivalent, say <New Rule> Not equivalent </New Rule>.
- If the new equivalence rule is already repeated in the examples listed, say <New Rule> Rule exists </New Rule>.
- The new rule should be be MINIMAL to CLEARLY demonstrate the highlighted semantic difference. Use ellipses to shorten SQL queries where necessary to achieve this.

Take a Deep Breath and Carefully Follow the Rules, Guides and Examples I gave you. I will tip you $2000 if you do EVERYTHING Perfectly.



Pair of SQL Queries:
<Gold SQL Query>
SELECT COUNT(T1.id) FROM cards AS T1 INNER JOIN legalities AS T2 ON T1.uuid = T2.uuid WHERE T2.status = 'Banned' AND T1.borderColor = 'white';
</Gold SQL Query>

<Machine-generated SQL Query>
SELECT count(*) FROM cards INNER JOIN legalities ON cards.uuid = legalities.uuid WHERE legalities.status = 'Banned' AND cards.bordercolor = 'white';
</Machine-generated SQL Query>

Given that `T1.id` is a primary key, `count(T1.id)` and `count(*)` will produce the same result.\n- The queries select logically equivalent results.\n\n### Step 4: Consider Edge Cases and Data Variations\n\n- The use of `count(T1.id)` vs. `count(*)` does not affect the result since `id` is a primary key and cannot be NULL.\n- The case sensitivity of `borderColor` vs. `bordercolor` does not affect the result as SQL is case-insensitive for identifiers by default.\n\n### Step 5: Evaluate Aggregations and Calculations\n\n- Both queries use counting aggregation, and the logic behind them is equivalent.\n\n### Step 6: Check for Logical Equivalence in Conditional Expressions\n\n- No conditional expressions are present beyond the WHERE clause, which is equivalent.\n\n### Step 7: Assess Ordering of Results\n\n- No ORDER BY clause is present in either query, so result ordering is not a concern.\n\n### Step 8: Generate a New Logical Equivalence Rule\n\nAfter evaluating the queries, they are logically equivalent. The difference in column naming case (`borderColor` vs. `bordercolor`) and the use of `COUNT(T1.id)` vs. `count(*)` do not affect the logic or results due to the schema conditions.\n\n<New Rule>\nEquivalent Queries:\nSELECT COUNT(c1) FROM t1 INNER JOIN t2 ON t1.c2 = t2.c2 WHERE t2.c3 = 'value' AND t1.c4 = 'value';\nSELECT count(*) FROM t1 INNER JOIN t2 ON t1.c2 = t2.c2 WHERE t2.c3 = 'value' AND t1.c4 = 'value';\nSchema Conditions:\nc1 is the primary key of t1.\n", role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None, refusal=None))], created=1732079929, model='gpt-4o-2024-08-06', object='chat.completion', system_fingerprint='fp_831e067d82', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=830, prompt_tokens=2002, total_tokens=2832, prompt_tokens_details={'cached_tokens': 0, 'audio_tokens': 0}, completion_tokens_details={'reasoning_tokens': 0, 'audio_tokens': 0, 'accepted_prediction_tokens': 0, 'rejected_prediction_tokens': 0}))

INFO:root:model: gpt-4o
INFO:root:prompt: You are an expert SQL engineer with 20+ years of experience. You will be given some SQL equivalence rules conditional on some database schemas. You will then be given a pair of SQL queries, consisting of a gold query and a machine-generated query, and a database schema that defines the context of the queries. 

Your task is to compare the two provided SQL queries on logical equivalence and generate one more equivalence rule in the same format as the provided example equivalence rules.

Please make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please also keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.



Evaluation Criteria:

Logical equivalence - the alignment between the gold SQL query and the machine-generated SQL query. A machine-generated SQL query is logically equivalent to the gold query if these two queries would RETURN THE SAME RESULTS AND IN THE SAME ORDER for ALL POSSIBLE DATABASE INSTANCES that satisfy the provided database schema for these queries. Annotators were asked to penalize machine-generated queries that overlooked edge cases that the gold queries would have caught otherwise.



Evaluation steps:

1. Understand the Database Schema: Identify all tables used in both queries. List all columns referenced, along with their data types and constraints. Determine primary and foreign key relationships. Note any indexes or unique constraints that may affect query execution.
2. Parse and Break Down Each Query: Identify selected columns, functions, and expressions. Note the tables involved and the join conditions. Understand the filtering conditions applied. Identify grouping and aggregate conditions, if any. Determine if result ordering affects equivalence.
3. Compare Query Components: Check if both queries use the same tables and join conditions. Compare filtering conditions in the WHERE clauses. Assess whether the same columns and expressions are selected. Identify if different functions or syntaxes achieve the same result. Look for logical equivalence in expressions and calculations.
4. Consider Edge Cases and Data Variations: Conceptualize sample datasets that include edge cases (e.g., NULL values, zero values, special characters). Analyze how each query handles these edge cases. Ensure that data type differences do not affect the outcome. Verify that constraints (e.g., NOT NULL, UNIQUE) are accounted for.
5. Evaluate Aggregations and Calculations: Confirm that aggregate functions (e.g., SUM, COUNT) are applied identically. Ensure calculations (e.g., subtraction, addition) produce the same results.
6. Check for Logical Equivalence in Conditional Expressions: Compare conditional expressions like IIF, CASE WHEN, and IF. Determine if conditions and returned values are logically the same.
7. Assess Ordering of Results: If ORDER BY clause is present, confirm that both queries order results identically. Recognize that differing order may affect equivalence if result order is significant.
8. Generate a New Logical Equivalence Rule (If Applicable): Create an "Equivalent Queries: <query1>
<query2>
Schema Conditions:<conditions>" statement that defines the equivalence. Use GENERALIZED COLUMN and TABLE NAMES. Specify any necessary conditions based on the database schema. Present the rule clearly, indicating both the equivalence and the conditions under which it holds.



Example Equivalence Rules:

<Rule>
Equivalent Queries:
SELECT c1 from t1 WHERE ...;
SELECT c1 FROM t1 WHERE ...;
Schema Conditions:
None.
</Rule>



# Guidelines:
- Make SURE complete to every step PERFECTLY without ANY Mistakes
- Follow the Rules I Gave you and Remember to AVOID generating repeated equivalence rules in the examples I gave you.
- Be sure to format your response like the example equivalence rules I gave you.
- Put <New Rule></New Rule> around the new equivalence rule that you think of. Do not use other formatting around the equivalent queries.
- Use GENERALIZED COLUMN AND TABLE NAMES in any EQUIVALENCE RULE YOU WRITE. DO NOT USE THE SAME NAMES IN THE PROVIDED QUERY PAIRS!!!!
- If the two queries are not logically equivalent, say <New Rule> Not equivalent </New Rule>.
- If the new equivalence rule is already repeated in the examples listed, say <New Rule> Rule exists </New Rule>.
- The new rule should be be MINIMAL to CLEARLY demonstrate the highlighted semantic difference. Use ellipses to shorten SQL queries where necessary to achieve this.

Take a Deep Breath and Carefully Follow the Rules, Guides and Examples I gave you. I will tip you $2000 if you do EVERYTHING Perfectly.



Pair of SQL Queries:
<Gold SQL Query>
SELECT COUNT(T1.id) FROM sets AS T1 INNER JOIN set_translations AS T2 ON T1.code = T2.setCode WHERE T2.language = 'Portuguese (Brazil)' AND T1.block = 'Commander';
</Gold SQL Query>

<Machine-generated SQL Query>
SELECT count(*) FROM sets INNER JOIN set_translations ON sets.code = set_translations.setcode WHERE sets.block = 'Commander' AND set_translations.language = 'Portuguese (Brazil)';
</Machine-generated SQL Query>

Given the schema, `id` is a non-null primary key in the `sets` table, so `COUNT(id)` and `count(*)` are equivalent.\n\n### Step 4: Consider Edge Cases and Data Variations\n- Both queries filter on the same conditions and would handle edge cases similarly.\n- The use of `COUNT(id)` versus `count(*)` does not affect the outcome due to the non-null constraint on `id`.\n\n### Step 5: Evaluate Aggregations and Calculations\n- The aggregation function used (`COUNT`) is applied identically in terms of logic.\n\n### Step 6: Check for Logical Equivalence in Conditional Expressions\n- There are no complex conditional expressions beyond the WHERE clause, which are equivalent.\n\n### Step 7: Assess Ordering of Results\n- No `ORDER BY` clause is present in either query, so result ordering does not affect equivalence.\n\n### Step 8: Generate a New Logical Equivalence Rule\nThe queries are logically equivalent.

INFO:root:prompt: You are an expert SQL engineer with 20+ years of experience. You will be given some SQL equivalence rules conditional on some database schemas. You will then be given a pair of SQL queries, consisting of a gold query and a machine-generated query, and a database schema that defines the context of the queries. 

Your task is to compare the two provided SQL queries on logical equivalence and generate one more equivalence rule in the same format as the provided example equivalence rules.

Please make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please also keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.



Evaluation Criteria:

Logical equivalence - the alignment between the gold SQL query and the machine-generated SQL query. A machine-generated SQL query is logically equivalent to the gold query if these two queries would RETURN THE SAME RESULTS AND IN THE SAME ORDER for ALL POSSIBLE DATABASE INSTANCES that satisfy the provided database schema for these queries. Annotators were asked to penalize machine-generated queries that overlooked edge cases that the gold queries would have caught otherwise.



Evaluation steps:

1. Understand the Database Schema: Identify all tables used in both queries. List all columns referenced, along with their data types and constraints. Determine primary and foreign key relationships. Note any indexes or unique constraints that may affect query execution.
2. Parse and Break Down Each Query: Identify selected columns, functions, and expressions. Note the tables involved and the join conditions. Understand the filtering conditions applied. Identify grouping and aggregate conditions, if any. Determine if result ordering affects equivalence.
3. Compare Query Components: Check if both queries use the same tables and join conditions. Compare filtering conditions in the WHERE clauses. Assess whether the same columns and expressions are selected. Identify if different functions or syntaxes achieve the same result. Look for logical equivalence in expressions and calculations.
4. Consider Edge Cases and Data Variations: Conceptualize sample datasets that include edge cases (e.g., NULL values, zero values, special characters). Analyze how each query handles these edge cases. Ensure that data type differences do not affect the outcome. Verify that constraints (e.g., NOT NULL, UNIQUE) are accounted for.
5. Evaluate Aggregations and Calculations: Confirm that aggregate functions (e.g., SUM, COUNT) are applied identically. Ensure calculations (e.g., subtraction, addition) produce the same results.
6. Check for Logical Equivalence in Conditional Expressions: Compare conditional expressions like IIF, CASE WHEN, and IF. Determine if conditions and returned values are logically the same.
7. Assess Ordering of Results: If ORDER BY clause is present, confirm that both queries order results identically. Recognize that differing order may affect equivalence if result order is significant.
8. Generate a New Logical Equivalence Rule (If Applicable): Create an "Equivalent Queries: <query1>
<query2>
Schema Conditions:<conditions>" statement that defines the equivalence. Use GENERALIZED COLUMN and TABLE NAMES. Specify any necessary conditions based on the database schema. Present the rule clearly, indicating both the equivalence and the conditions under which it holds.



Example Equivalence Rules:

<Rule>
Equivalent Queries:
SELECT c1 from t1 WHERE ...;
SELECT c1 FROM t1 WHERE ...;
Schema Conditions:
None.
</Rule>



# Guidelines:
- Make SURE complete to every step PERFECTLY without ANY Mistakes
- Follow the Rules I Gave you and Remember to AVOID generating repeated equivalence rules in the examples I gave you.
- Be sure to format your response like the example equivalence rules I gave you.
- Put <New Rule></New Rule> around the new equivalence rule that you think of. Do not use other formatting around the equivalent queries.
- Use GENERALIZED COLUMN AND TABLE NAMES in any EQUIVALENCE RULE YOU WRITE. DO NOT USE THE SAME NAMES IN THE PROVIDED QUERY PAIRS!!!!
- If the two queries are not logically equivalent, say <New Rule> Not equivalent </New Rule>.
- If the new equivalence rule is already repeated in the examples listed, say <New Rule> Rule exists </New Rule>.
- The new rule should be be MINIMAL to CLEARLY demonstrate the highlighted semantic difference. Use ellipses to shorten SQL queries where necessary to achieve this.

Take a Deep Breath and Carefully Follow the Rules, Guides and Examples I gave you. I will tip you $2000 if you do EVERYTHING Perfectly.



Pair of SQL Queries:
<Gold SQL Query>
SELECT name FROM foreign_data WHERE uuid IN ( SELECT uuid FROM cards WHERE types = 'Creature' AND layout = 'normal' AND borderColor = 'black' AND artist = 'Matthew D. Wilson' ) AND language = 'French';
</Gold SQL Query>

<Machine-generated SQL Query>
SELECT foreign_data.name FROM cards INNER JOIN foreign_data ON cards.uuid = foreign_data.uuid WHERE foreign_data.language = 'French' AND cards.artist = 'Matthew D. Wilson' AND cards.layout = 'normal' AND cards.bordercolor = 'black' AND cards.types = 'Creature';

INFO:root:prompt: You are an expert SQL engineer with 20+ years of experience. You will be given some SQL equivalence rules conditional on some database schemas. You will then be given a pair of SQL queries, consisting of a gold query and a machine-generated query, and a database schema that defines the context of the queries. 

Your task is to compare the two provided SQL queries on logical equivalence and generate one more equivalence rule in the same format as the provided example equivalence rules.

Please make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please also keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.



Evaluation Criteria:

Logical equivalence - the alignment between the gold SQL query and the machine-generated SQL query. A machine-generated SQL query is logically equivalent to the gold query if these two queries would RETURN THE SAME RESULTS AND IN THE SAME ORDER for ALL POSSIBLE DATABASE INSTANCES that satisfy the provided database schema for these queries. Annotators were asked to penalize machine-generated queries that overlooked edge cases that the gold queries would have caught otherwise.



Evaluation steps:

1. Understand the Database Schema: Identify all tables used in both queries. List all columns referenced, along with their data types and constraints. Determine primary and foreign key relationships. Note any indexes or unique constraints that may affect query execution.
2. Parse and Break Down Each Query: Identify selected columns, functions, and expressions. Note the tables involved and the join conditions. Understand the filtering conditions applied. Identify grouping and aggregate conditions, if any. Determine if result ordering affects equivalence.
3. Compare Query Components: Check if both queries use the same tables and join conditions. Compare filtering conditions in the WHERE clauses. Assess whether the same columns and expressions are selected. Identify if different functions or syntaxes achieve the same result. Look for logical equivalence in expressions and calculations.
4. Consider Edge Cases and Data Variations: Conceptualize sample datasets that include edge cases (e.g., NULL values, zero values, special characters). Analyze how each query handles these edge cases. Ensure that data type differences do not affect the outcome. Verify that constraints (e.g., NOT NULL, UNIQUE) are accounted for.
5. Evaluate Aggregations and Calculations: Confirm that aggregate functions (e.g., SUM, COUNT) are applied identically. Ensure calculations (e.g., subtraction, addition) produce the same results.
6. Check for Logical Equivalence in Conditional Expressions: Compare conditional expressions like IIF, CASE WHEN, and IF. Determine if conditions and returned values are logically the same.
7. Assess Ordering of Results: If ORDER BY clause is present, confirm that both queries order results identically. Recognize that differing order may affect equivalence if result order is significant.
8. Generate a New Logical Equivalence Rule (If Applicable): Create an "Equivalent Queries: <query1>
<query2>
Schema Conditions:<conditions>" statement that defines the equivalence. Use GENERALIZED COLUMN and TABLE NAMES. Specify any necessary conditions based on the database schema. Present the rule clearly, indicating both the equivalence and the conditions under which it holds.



Example Equivalence Rules:

<Rule>
Equivalent Queries:
SELECT c1 from t1 WHERE ...;
SELECT c1 FROM t1 WHERE ...;
Schema Conditions:
None.
</Rule>



# Guidelines:
- Make SURE complete to every step PERFECTLY without ANY Mistakes
- Follow the Rules I Gave you and Remember to AVOID generating repeated equivalence rules in the examples I gave you.
- Be sure to format your response like the example equivalence rules I gave you.
- Put <New Rule></New Rule> around the new equivalence rule that you think of. Do not use other formatting around the equivalent queries.
- Use GENERALIZED COLUMN AND TABLE NAMES in any EQUIVALENCE RULE YOU WRITE. DO NOT USE THE SAME NAMES IN THE PROVIDED QUERY PAIRS!!!!
- If the two queries are not logically equivalent, say <New Rule> Not equivalent </New Rule>.
- If the new equivalence rule is already repeated in the examples listed, say <New Rule> Rule exists </New Rule>.
- The new rule should be be MINIMAL to CLEARLY demonstrate the highlighted semantic difference. Use ellipses to shorten SQL queries where necessary to achieve this.

Take a Deep Breath and Carefully Follow the Rules, Guides and Examples I gave you. I will tip you $2000 if you do EVERYTHING Perfectly.

In most SQL systems, `language` and `LANGUAGE` would be treated the same.\n\n### Step 5: Evaluate Aggregations and Calculations\n- There are no aggregations or calculations in these queries.\n\n### Step 6: Check for Logical Equivalence in Conditional Expressions\n- Both queries use the same conditional expression (`multiverseid = 149934`).\n\n### Step 7: Assess Ordering of Results\n- There is no `ORDER BY` clause in either query, so result ordering does not affect equivalence.\n\n### Step 8: Generate a New Logical Equivalence Rule (If Applicable)\n- Since both queries are logically equivalent and the only difference is the case sensitivity in the column name, which is generally not significant in SQL, we can define an equivalence rule based on this observation.\n\n<New Rule>\nEquivalent Queries:\nSELECT c1 FROM t1 WHERE ...;\nSELECT C1 FROM t1 WHERE ...;\nSchema Conditions:\nNone.\n", role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None, refusal=None))], created=1732079990, model='gpt-4o-2024-08-06', object='chat.completion', system_fingerprint='fp_831e067d82', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=438, prompt_tokens=1953, total_tokens=2391, prompt_tokens_details={'cached_tokens': 0, 'audio_tokens': 0}, completion_tokens_details={'reasoning_tokens': 0, 'audio_tokens': 0, 'accepted_prediction_tokens': 0, 'rejected_prediction_tokens': 0}))

Your task is to compare the two provided SQL queries on logical equivalence and generate one more equivalence rule in the same format as the provided example equivalence rules.

Please make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please also keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.



Evaluation Criteria:

Logical equivalence - the alignment between the gold SQL query and the machine-generated SQL query. A machine-generated SQL query is logically equivalent to the gold query if these two queries would RETURN THE SAME RESULTS AND IN THE SAME ORDER for ALL POSSIBLE DATABASE INSTANCES that satisfy the provided database schema for these queries. Annotators were asked to penalize machine-generated queries that overlooked edge cases that the gold queries would have caught otherwise.



Evaluation steps:

1. Understand the Database Schema: Identify all tables used in both queries. List all columns referenced, along with their data types and constraints. Determine primary and foreign key relationships. Note any indexes or unique constraints that may affect query execution.
2. Parse and Break Down Each Query: Identify selected columns, functions, and expressions. Note the tables involved and the join conditions. Understand the filtering conditions applied. Identify grouping and aggregate conditions, if any. Determine if result ordering affects equivalence.
3. Compare Query Components: Check if both queries use the same tables and join conditions. Compare filtering conditions in the WHERE clauses. Assess whether the same columns and expressions are selected. Identify if different functions or syntaxes achieve the same result. Look for logical equivalence in expressions and calculations.
4. Consider Edge Cases and Data Variations: Conceptualize sample datasets that include edge cases (e.g., NULL values, zero values, special characters). Analyze how each query handles these edge cases. Ensure that data type differences do not affect the outcome. Verify that constraints (e.g., NOT NULL, UNIQUE) are accounted for.
5. Evaluate Aggregations and Calculations: Confirm that aggregate functions (e.g., SUM, COUNT) are applied identically. Ensure calculations (e.g., subtraction, addition) produce the same results.
6. Check for Logical Equivalence in Conditional Expressions: Compare conditional expressions like IIF, CASE WHEN, and IF. Determine if conditions and returned values are logically the same.
7. Assess Ordering of Results: If ORDER BY clause is present, confirm that both queries order results identically. Recognize that differing order may affect equivalence if result order is significant.
8. Generate a New Logical Equivalence Rule (If Applicable): Create an "Equivalent Queries: <query1>
<query2>
Schema Conditions:<conditions>" statement that defines the equivalence. Use GENERALIZED COLUMN and TABLE NAMES. Specify any necessary conditions based on the database schema. Present the rule clearly, indicating both the equivalence and the conditions under which it holds.



Example Equivalence Rules:

<Rule>
Equivalent Queries:
SELECT c1 from t1 WHERE ...;
SELECT c1 FROM t1 WHERE ...;
Schema Conditions:
None.
</Rule>



# Guidelines:
- Make SURE complete to every step PERFECTLY without ANY Mistakes
- Follow the Rules I Gave you and Remember to AVOID generating repeated equivalence rules in the examples I gave you.
- Be sure to format your response like the example equivalence rules I gave you.
- Put <New Rule></New Rule> around the new equivalence rule that you think of. Do not use other formatting around the equivalent queries.
- Use GENERALIZED COLUMN AND TABLE NAMES in any EQUIVALENCE RULE YOU WRITE. DO NOT USE THE SAME NAMES IN THE PROVIDED QUERY PAIRS!!!!
- If the two queries are not logically equivalent, say <New Rule> Not equivalent </New Rule>.
- If the new equivalence rule is already repeated in the examples listed, say <New Rule> Rule exists </New Rule>.
- The new rule should be be MINIMAL to CLEARLY demonstrate the highlighted semantic difference. Use ellipses to shorten SQL queries where necessary to achieve this.

Take a Deep Breath and Carefully Follow the Rules, Guides and Examples I gave you. I will tip you $2000 if you do EVERYTHING Perfectly.



Pair of SQL Queries:
<Gold SQL Query>
SELECT T2.language FROM sets AS T1 INNER JOIN set_translations AS T2 ON T1.code = T2.setCode WHERE T1.mcmName = 'Archenemy' AND T2.setCode = 'ARC';
</Gold SQL Query>

<Machine-generated SQL Query>
SELECT DISTINCT set_translations.language FROM sets INNER JOIN set_translations ON sets.code = set_translations.setcode WHERE sets.mcmname = 'Archenemy' AND sets.code = 'ARC';
</Machine-generated SQL Query>

Let's break down the queries and the schema:\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Database Schema\n- **Tables Involved**: `sets`, `set_translations`\n- **Referenced Columns**:\n  - `sets`: `code`, `mcmName`\n  - `set_translations`: `language`, `setCode`\n- **Primary and Foreign Key Relationships**:\n  - `set_translations.setCode` references `sets.code`\n- **Constraints**:\n  - `sets.code` is unique.\n\n### Step 2: Parse and Break Down Each Query\n- **Gold SQL Query**:\n  - **Selected Columns**: `T2.language`\n  - **Tables Involved**: `sets AS T1`, `set_translations AS T2`\n  - **Join Condition**: `T1.code = T2.setCode`\n  - **Filtering Conditions**: `T1.mcmName = 'Archenemy' AND T2.setCode = 'ARC'`\n\n- **Machine-generated SQL Query**:\n  - **Selected Columns**: `set_translations.language`\n  - **Tables Involved**: `sets`, `set_translations`\n  - **Join Condition**: `sets.code = set_translations.setcode`\n  - **Filtering Conditions**: `sets.mcmname = 'Archenemy' AND sets.code = 'ARC'`\n  - **Distinct**: Applied to the selected language\n\n### Step 3: Compare Query Components\n- Both queries use the same tables and join conditions.\n- The filtering conditions differ slightly: \n  - Gold query filters on `T2.setCode = 'ARC'`.\n  - Machine-generated query filters on `sets.code = 'ARC'`.\n- The `DISTINCT` keyword in the machine-generated query does not affect the result due to the unique constraint on `sets.code`.\n\n### Step 4: Consider Edge Cases and Data Variations\n- **Edge Cases**: \n  - The `DISTINCT` keyword in the machine-generated query will not affect the result since `sets.code` is unique, ensuring one-to-one mapping with `set_translations.setCode`.\n  - Both queries will return the same results for any dataset satisfying the schema.\n\n### Step 5: Evaluate Aggregations and Calculations\n- There are no aggregations or calculations in these queries.\n\n### Step 6: Check for Logical Equivalence in Conditional Expressions\n- Both queries have equivalent filtering conditions due to the unique constraint on `sets.code`.\n\n### Step 7: Assess Ordering of Results\n- Neither query includes an `ORDER BY` clause, so result ordering is not a factor.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe queries are logically equivalent. Both queries will return the same results for any database instance that satisfies the schema.\n\n### Step 8: Generate a New Logical Equivalence Rule\nSince the queries are equivalent, let's generate a new equivalence rule:\n\n<New Rule>\nEquivalent Queries:\nSELECT col1 FROM table1 INNER JOIN table2 ON table1.col2 = table2.col3 WHERE table1.col4 = 'value' AND table2.col3 = 'constant';\nSELECT DISTINCT table2.col1 FROM table1 INNER JOIN table2 ON table1.col2 = table2.col3 WHERE table1.col4 = 'value' AND table1.col2 = 'constant';\nSchema Conditions:\ntable1.col2 is unique.\n", role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None, refusal=None))], created=1732079998, model='gpt-4o-2024-08-06', object='chat.completion', system_fingerprint='fp_831e067d82', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=708, prompt_tokens=2012, total_tokens=2720, prompt_tokens_details={'cached_tokens': 0, 'audio_tokens': 0}, completion_tokens_details={'reasoning_tokens': 0, 'audio_tokens': 0, 'accepted_prediction_tokens': 0, 'rejected_prediction_tokens': 0}))

1. Understand the Database Schema: Identify all tables used in both queries. List all columns referenced, along with their data types and constraints. Determine primary and foreign key relationships. Note any indexes or unique constraints that may affect query execution.
2. Parse and Break Down Each Query: Identify selected columns, functions, and expressions. Note the tables involved and the join conditions. Understand the filtering conditions applied. Identify grouping and aggregate conditions, if any. Determine if result ordering affects equivalence.
3. Compare Query Components: Check if both queries use the same tables and join conditions. Compare filtering conditions in the WHERE clauses. Assess whether the same columns and expressions are selected. Identify if different functions or syntaxes achieve the same result. Look for logical equivalence in expressions and calculations.
4. Consider Edge Cases and Data Variations: Conceptualize sample datasets that include edge cases (e.g., NULL values, zero values, special characters). Analyze how each query handles these edge cases. Ensure that data type differences do not affect the outcome. Verify that constraints (e.g., NOT NULL, UNIQUE) are accounted for.
5. Evaluate Aggregations and Calculations: Confirm that aggregate functions (e.g., SUM, COUNT) are applied identically. Ensure calculations (e.g., subtraction, addition) produce the same results.
6. Check for Logical Equivalence in Conditional Expressions: Compare conditional expressions like IIF, CASE WHEN, and IF. Determine if conditions and returned values are logically the same.
7. Assess Ordering of Results: If ORDER BY clause is present, confirm that both queries order results identically. Recognize that differing order may affect equivalence if result order is significant.
8. Generate a New Logical Equivalence Rule (If Applicable): Create an "Equivalent Queries: <query1>
<query2>
Schema Conditions:<conditions>" statement that defines the equivalence. Use GENERALIZED COLUMN and TABLE NAMES. Specify any necessary conditions based on the database schema. Present the rule clearly, indicating both the equivalence and the conditions under which it holds.



Example Equivalence Rules:

<Rule>
Equivalent Queries:
SELECT c1 from t1 WHERE ...;
SELECT c1 FROM t1 WHERE ...;
Schema Conditions:
None.
</Rule>



# Guidelines:
- Make SURE complete to every step PERFECTLY without ANY Mistakes
- Follow the Rules I Gave you and Remember to AVOID generating repeated equivalence rules in the examples I gave you.
- Be sure to format your response like the example equivalence rules I gave you.
- Put <New Rule></New Rule> around the new equivalence rule that you think of. Do not use other formatting around the equivalent queries.
- Use GENERALIZED COLUMN AND TABLE NAMES in any EQUIVALENCE RULE YOU WRITE. DO NOT USE THE SAME NAMES IN THE PROVIDED QUERY PAIRS!!!!
- If the two queries are not logically equivalent, say <New Rule> Not equivalent </New Rule>.
- If the new equivalence rule is already repeated in the examples listed, say <New Rule> Rule exists </New Rule>.
- The new rule should be be MINIMAL to CLEARLY demonstrate the highlighted semantic difference. Use ellipses to shorten SQL queries where necessary to achieve this.

Take a Deep Breath and Carefully Follow the Rules, Guides and Examples I gave you. I will tip you $2000 if you do EVERYTHING Perfectly.

INFO:root:model: gpt-4o
INFO:root:prompt: You are an expert SQL engineer with 20+ years of experience. You will be given some SQL equivalence rules conditional on some database schemas. You will then be given a pair of SQL queries, consisting of a gold query and a machine-generated query, and a database schema that defines the context of the queries. 

Your task is to compare the two provided SQL queries on logical equivalence and generate one more equivalence rule in the same format as the provided example equivalence rules.

Please make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please also keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.



Evaluation Criteria:

Logical equivalence - the alignment between the gold SQL query and the machine-generated SQL query. A machine-generated SQL query is logically equivalent to the gold query if these two queries would RETURN THE SAME RESULTS AND IN THE SAME ORDER for ALL POSSIBLE DATABASE INSTANCES that satisfy the provided database schema for these queries. Annotators were asked to penalize machine-generated queries that overlooked edge cases that the gold queries would have caught otherwise.



Evaluation steps:

1. Understand the Database Schema: Identify all tables used in both queries. List all columns referenced, along with their data types and constraints. Determine primary and foreign key relationships. Note any indexes or unique constraints that may affect query execution.
2. Parse and Break Down Each Query: Identify selected columns, functions, and expressions. Note the tables involved and the join conditions. Understand the filtering conditions applied. Identify grouping and aggregate conditions, if any. Determine if result ordering affects equivalence.
3. Compare Query Components: Check if both queries use the same tables and join conditions. Compare filtering conditions in the WHERE clauses. Assess whether the same columns and expressions are selected. Identify if different functions or syntaxes achieve the same result. Look for logical equivalence in expressions and calculations.
4. Consider Edge Cases and Data Variations: Conceptualize sample datasets that include edge cases (e.g., NULL values, zero values, special characters). Analyze how each query handles these edge cases. Ensure that data type differences do not affect the outcome. Verify that constraints (e.g., NOT NULL, UNIQUE) are accounted for.
5. Evaluate Aggregations and Calculations: Confirm that aggregate functions (e.g., SUM, COUNT) are applied identically. Ensure calculations (e.g., subtraction, addition) produce the same results.
6. Check for Logical Equivalence in Conditional Expressions: Compare conditional expressions like IIF, CASE WHEN, and IF. Determine if conditions and returned values are logically the same.
7. Assess Ordering of Results: If ORDER BY clause is present, confirm that both queries order results identically. Recognize that differing order may affect equivalence if result order is significant.
8. Generate a New Logical Equivalence Rule (If Applicable): Create an "Equivalent Queries: <query1>
<query2>
Schema Conditions:<conditions>" statement that defines the equivalence. Use GENERALIZED COLUMN and TABLE NAMES. Specify any necessary conditions based on the database schema. Present the rule clearly, indicating both the equivalence and the conditions under which it holds.



Example Equivalence Rules:

<Rule>
Equivalent Queries:
SELECT c1 from t1 WHERE ...;
SELECT c1 FROM t1 WHERE ...;
Schema Conditions:
None.
</Rule>



# Guidelines:
- Make SURE complete to every step PERFECTLY without ANY Mistakes
- Follow the Rules I Gave you and Remember to AVOID generating repeated equivalence rules in the examples I gave you.
- Be sure to format your response like the example equivalence rules I gave you.
- Put <New Rule></New Rule> around the new equivalence rule that you think of. Do not use other formatting around the equivalent queries.
- Use GENERALIZED COLUMN AND TABLE NAMES in any EQUIVALENCE RULE YOU WRITE. DO NOT USE THE SAME NAMES IN THE PROVIDED QUERY PAIRS!!!!
- If the two queries are not logically equivalent, say <New Rule> Not equivalent </New Rule>.
- If the new equivalence rule is already repeated in the examples listed, say <New Rule> Rule exists </New Rule>.
- The new rule should be be MINIMAL to CLEARLY demonstrate the highlighted semantic difference. Use ellipses to shorten SQL queries where necessary to achieve this.

Take a Deep Breath and Carefully Follow the Rules, Guides and Examples I gave you. I will tip you $2000 if you do EVERYTHING Perfectly.



Pair of SQL Queries:
<Gold SQL Query>
SELECT T2.translation FROM sets AS T1 INNER JOIN set_translations AS T2 ON T2.setCode = T1.code WHERE T1.name = 'Eighth Edition' AND T2.language = 'Chinese Simplified';
</Gold SQL Query>

<Machine-generated SQL Query>
SELECT set_translations.translation FROM sets INNER JOIN set_translations ON sets.code = set_translations.setcode WHERE sets.name = 'Eighth Edition' AND set_translations.language = 'Chinese Simplified';

INFO:root:model: gpt-4o
INFO:root:prompt: You are an expert SQL engineer with 20+ years of experience. You will be given some SQL equivalence rules conditional on some database schemas. You will then be given a pair of SQL queries, consisting of a gold query and a machine-generated query, and a database schema that defines the context of the queries. 

Your task is to compare the two provided SQL queries on logical equivalence and generate one more equivalence rule in the same format as the provided example equivalence rules.

Please make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please also keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.



Evaluation Criteria:

Logical equivalence - the alignment between the gold SQL query and the machine-generated SQL query. A machine-generated SQL query is logically equivalent to the gold query if these two queries would RETURN THE SAME RESULTS AND IN THE SAME ORDER for ALL POSSIBLE DATABASE INSTANCES that satisfy the provided database schema for these queries. Annotators were asked to penalize machine-generated queries that overlooked edge cases that the gold queries would have caught otherwise.



Evaluation steps:

1. Understand the Database Schema: Identify all tables used in both queries. List all columns referenced, along with their data types and constraints. Determine primary and foreign key relationships. Note any indexes or unique constraints that may affect query execution.
2. Parse and Break Down Each Query: Identify selected columns, functions, and expressions. Note the tables involved and the join conditions. Understand the filtering conditions applied. Identify grouping and aggregate conditions, if any. Determine if result ordering affects equivalence.
3. Compare Query Components: Check if both queries use the same tables and join conditions. Compare filtering conditions in the WHERE clauses. Assess whether the same columns and expressions are selected. Identify if different functions or syntaxes achieve the same result. Look for logical equivalence in expressions and calculations.
4. Consider Edge Cases and Data Variations: Conceptualize sample datasets that include edge cases (e.g., NULL values, zero values, special characters). Analyze how each query handles these edge cases. Ensure that data type differences do not affect the outcome. Verify that constraints (e.g., NOT NULL, UNIQUE) are accounted for.
5. Evaluate Aggregations and Calculations: Confirm that aggregate functions (e.g., SUM, COUNT) are applied identically. Ensure calculations (e.g., subtraction, addition) produce the same results.
6. Check for Logical Equivalence in Conditional Expressions: Compare conditional expressions like IIF, CASE WHEN, and IF. Determine if conditions and returned values are logically the same.
7. Assess Ordering of Results: If ORDER BY clause is present, confirm that both queries order results identically. Recognize that differing order may affect equivalence if result order is significant.
8. Generate a New Logical Equivalence Rule (If Applicable): Create an "Equivalent Queries: <query1>
<query2>
Schema Conditions:<conditions>" statement that defines the equivalence. Use GENERALIZED COLUMN and TABLE NAMES. Specify any necessary conditions based on the database schema. Present the rule clearly, indicating both the equivalence and the conditions under which it holds.



Example Equivalence Rules:

<Rule>
Equivalent Queries:
SELECT c1 from t1 WHERE ...;
SELECT c1 FROM t1 WHERE ...;
Schema Conditions:
None.
</Rule>



# Guidelines:
- Make SURE complete to every step PERFECTLY without ANY Mistakes
- Follow the Rules I Gave you and Remember to AVOID generating repeated equivalence rules in the examples I gave you.
- Be sure to format your response like the example equivalence rules I gave you.
- Put <New Rule></New Rule> around the new equivalence rule that you think of. Do not use other formatting around the equivalent queries.
- Use GENERALIZED COLUMN AND TABLE NAMES in any EQUIVALENCE RULE YOU WRITE. DO NOT USE THE SAME NAMES IN THE PROVIDED QUERY PAIRS!!!!
- If the two queries are not logically equivalent, say <New Rule> Not equivalent </New Rule>.
- If the new equivalence rule is already repeated in the examples listed, say <New Rule> Rule exists </New Rule>.
- The new rule should be be MINIMAL to CLEARLY demonstrate the highlighted semantic difference. Use ellipses to shorten SQL queries where necessary to achieve this.

Take a Deep Breath and Carefully Follow the Rules, Guides and Examples I gave you. I will tip you $2000 if you do EVERYTHING Perfectly.

INFO:root:model: gpt-4o
INFO:root:prompt: You are an expert SQL engineer with 20+ years of experience. You will be given some SQL equivalence rules conditional on some database schemas. You will then be given a pair of SQL queries, consisting of a gold query and a machine-generated query, and a database schema that defines the context of the queries. 

Your task is to compare the two provided SQL queries on logical equivalence and generate one more equivalence rule in the same format as the provided example equivalence rules.

Please make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please also keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.



Evaluation Criteria:

Logical equivalence - the alignment between the gold SQL query and the machine-generated SQL query. A machine-generated SQL query is logically equivalent to the gold query if these two queries would RETURN THE SAME RESULTS AND IN THE SAME ORDER for ALL POSSIBLE DATABASE INSTANCES that satisfy the provided database schema for these queries. Annotators were asked to penalize machine-generated queries that overlooked edge cases that the gold queries would have caught otherwise.



Evaluation steps:

1. Understand the Database Schema: Identify all tables used in both queries. List all columns referenced, along with their data types and constraints. Determine primary and foreign key relationships. Note any indexes or unique constraints that may affect query execution.
2. Parse and Break Down Each Query: Identify selected columns, functions, and expressions. Note the tables involved and the join conditions. Understand the filtering conditions applied. Identify grouping and aggregate conditions, if any. Determine if result ordering affects equivalence.
3. Compare Query Components: Check if both queries use the same tables and join conditions. Compare filtering conditions in the WHERE clauses. Assess whether the same columns and expressions are selected. Identify if different functions or syntaxes achieve the same result. Look for logical equivalence in expressions and calculations.
4. Consider Edge Cases and Data Variations: Conceptualize sample datasets that include edge cases (e.g., NULL values, zero values, special characters). Analyze how each query handles these edge cases. Ensure that data type differences do not affect the outcome. Verify that constraints (e.g., NOT NULL, UNIQUE) are accounted for.
5. Evaluate Aggregations and Calculations: Confirm that aggregate functions (e.g., SUM, COUNT) are applied identically. Ensure calculations (e.g., subtraction, addition) produce the same results.
6. Check for Logical Equivalence in Conditional Expressions: Compare conditional expressions like IIF, CASE WHEN, and IF. Determine if conditions and returned values are logically the same.
7. Assess Ordering of Results: If ORDER BY clause is present, confirm that both queries order results identically. Recognize that differing order may affect equivalence if result order is significant.
8. Generate a New Logical Equivalence Rule (If Applicable): Create an "Equivalent Queries: <query1>
<query2>
Schema Conditions:<conditions>" statement that defines the equivalence. Use GENERALIZED COLUMN and TABLE NAMES. Specify any necessary conditions based on the database schema. Present the rule clearly, indicating both the equivalence and the conditions under which it holds.



Example Equivalence Rules:

<Rule>
Equivalent Queries:
SELECT c1 from t1 WHERE ...;
SELECT c1 FROM t1 WHERE ...;
Schema Conditions:
None.
</Rule>



# Guidelines:
- Make SURE complete to every step PERFECTLY without ANY Mistakes
- Follow the Rules I Gave you and Remember to AVOID generating repeated equivalence rules in the examples I gave you.
- Be sure to format your response like the example equivalence rules I gave you.
- Put <New Rule></New Rule> around the new equivalence rule that you think of. Do not use other formatting around the equivalent queries.
- Use GENERALIZED COLUMN AND TABLE NAMES in any EQUIVALENCE RULE YOU WRITE. DO NOT USE THE SAME NAMES IN THE PROVIDED QUERY PAIRS!!!!
- If the two queries are not logically equivalent, say <New Rule> Not equivalent </New Rule>.
- If the new equivalence rule is already repeated in the examples listed, say <New Rule> Rule exists </New Rule>.
- The new rule should be be MINIMAL to CLEARLY demonstrate the highlighted semantic difference. Use ellipses to shorten SQL queries where necessary to achieve this.

Take a Deep Breath and Carefully Follow the Rules, Guides and Examples I gave you. I will tip you $2000 if you do EVERYTHING Perfectly.

INFO:root:prompt: You are an expert SQL engineer with 20+ years of experience. You will be given some SQL equivalence rules conditional on some database schemas. You will then be given a pair of SQL queries, consisting of a gold query and a machine-generated query, and a database schema that defines the context of the queries. 

Your task is to compare the two provided SQL queries on logical equivalence and generate one more equivalence rule in the same format as the provided example equivalence rules.

Please make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please also keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.



Evaluation Criteria:

Logical equivalence - the alignment between the gold SQL query and the machine-generated SQL query. A machine-generated SQL query is logically equivalent to the gold query if these two queries would RETURN THE SAME RESULTS AND IN THE SAME ORDER for ALL POSSIBLE DATABASE INSTANCES that satisfy the provided database schema for these queries. Annotators were asked to penalize machine-generated queries that overlooked edge cases that the gold queries would have caught otherwise.



Evaluation steps:

1. Understand the Database Schema: Identify all tables used in both queries. List all columns referenced, along with their data types and constraints. Determine primary and foreign key relationships. Note any indexes or unique constraints that may affect query execution.
2. Parse and Break Down Each Query: Identify selected columns, functions, and expressions. Note the tables involved and the join conditions. Understand the filtering conditions applied. Identify grouping and aggregate conditions, if any. Determine if result ordering affects equivalence.
3. Compare Query Components: Check if both queries use the same tables and join conditions. Compare filtering conditions in the WHERE clauses. Assess whether the same columns and expressions are selected. Identify if different functions or syntaxes achieve the same result. Look for logical equivalence in expressions and calculations.
4. Consider Edge Cases and Data Variations: Conceptualize sample datasets that include edge cases (e.g., NULL values, zero values, special characters). Analyze how each query handles these edge cases. Ensure that data type differences do not affect the outcome. Verify that constraints (e.g., NOT NULL, UNIQUE) are accounted for.
5. Evaluate Aggregations and Calculations: Confirm that aggregate functions (e.g., SUM, COUNT) are applied identically. Ensure calculations (e.g., subtraction, addition) produce the same results.
6. Check for Logical Equivalence in Conditional Expressions: Compare conditional expressions like IIF, CASE WHEN, and IF. Determine if conditions and returned values are logically the same.
7. Assess Ordering of Results: If ORDER BY clause is present, confirm that both queries order results identically. Recognize that differing order may affect equivalence if result order is significant.
8. Generate a New Logical Equivalence Rule (If Applicable): Create an "Equivalent Queries: <query1>
<query2>
Schema Conditions:<conditions>" statement that defines the equivalence. Use GENERALIZED COLUMN and TABLE NAMES. Specify any necessary conditions based on the database schema. Present the rule clearly, indicating both the equivalence and the conditions under which it holds.



Example Equivalence Rules:

<Rule>
Equivalent Queries:
SELECT c1 from t1 WHERE ...;
SELECT c1 FROM t1 WHERE ...;
Schema Conditions:
None.
</Rule>



# Guidelines:
- Make SURE complete to every step PERFECTLY without ANY Mistakes
- Follow the Rules I Gave you and Remember to AVOID generating repeated equivalence rules in the examples I gave you.
- Be sure to format your response like the example equivalence rules I gave you.
- Put <New Rule></New Rule> around the new equivalence rule that you think of. Do not use other formatting around the equivalent queries.
- Use GENERALIZED COLUMN AND TABLE NAMES in any EQUIVALENCE RULE YOU WRITE. DO NOT USE THE SAME NAMES IN THE PROVIDED QUERY PAIRS!!!!
- If the two queries are not logically equivalent, say <New Rule> Not equivalent </New Rule>.
- If the new equivalence rule is already repeated in the examples listed, say <New Rule> Rule exists </New Rule>.
- The new rule should be be MINIMAL to CLEARLY demonstrate the highlighted semantic difference. Use ellipses to shorten SQL queries where necessary to achieve this.

Take a Deep Breath and Carefully Follow the Rules, Guides and Examples I gave you. I will tip you $2000 if you do EVERYTHING Perfectly.

A machine-generated SQL query is logically equivalent to the gold query if these two queries would RETURN THE SAME RESULTS AND IN THE SAME ORDER for ALL POSSIBLE DATABASE INSTANCES that satisfy the provided database schema for these queries. Annotators were asked to penalize machine-generated queries that overlooked edge cases that the gold queries would have caught otherwise.



Evaluation steps:

1. Understand the Database Schema: Identify all tables used in both queries. List all columns referenced, along with their data types and constraints. Determine primary and foreign key relationships. Note any indexes or unique constraints that may affect query execution.
2. Parse and Break Down Each Query: Identify selected columns, functions, and expressions. Note the tables involved and the join conditions. Understand the filtering conditions applied. Identify grouping and aggregate conditions, if any. Determine if result ordering affects equivalence.
3. Compare Query Components: Check if both queries use the same tables and join conditions. Compare filtering conditions in the WHERE clauses. Assess whether the same columns and expressions are selected. Identify if different functions or syntaxes achieve the same result. Look for logical equivalence in expressions and calculations.
4. Consider Edge Cases and Data Variations: Conceptualize sample datasets that include edge cases (e.g., NULL values, zero values, special characters). Analyze how each query handles these edge cases. Ensure that data type differences do not affect the outcome. Verify that constraints (e.g., NOT NULL, UNIQUE) are accounted for.
5. Evaluate Aggregations and Calculations: Confirm that aggregate functions (e.g., SUM, COUNT) are applied identically. Ensure calculations (e.g., subtraction, addition) produce the same results.
6. Check for Logical Equivalence in Conditional Expressions: Compare conditional expressions like IIF, CASE WHEN, and IF. Determine if conditions and returned values are logically the same.
7. Assess Ordering of Results: If ORDER BY clause is present, confirm that both queries order results identically. Recognize that differing order may affect equivalence if result order is significant.
8. Generate a New Logical Equivalence Rule (If Applicable): Create an "Equivalent Queries: <query1>
<query2>
Schema Conditions:<conditions>" statement that defines the equivalence. Use GENERALIZED COLUMN and TABLE NAMES. Specify any necessary conditions based on the database schema. Present the rule clearly, indicating both the equivalence and the conditions under which it holds.



Example Equivalence Rules:

<Rule>
Equivalent Queries:
SELECT c1 from t1 WHERE ...;
SELECT c1 FROM t1 WHERE ...;
Schema Conditions:
None.
</Rule>



# Guidelines:
- Make SURE complete to every step PERFECTLY without ANY Mistakes
- Follow the Rules I Gave you and Remember to AVOID generating repeated equivalence rules in the examples I gave you.
- Be sure to format your response like the example equivalence rules I gave you.
- Put <New Rule></New Rule> around the new equivalence rule that you think of. Do not use other formatting around the equivalent queries.
- Use GENERALIZED COLUMN AND TABLE NAMES in any EQUIVALENCE RULE YOU WRITE. DO NOT USE THE SAME NAMES IN THE PROVIDED QUERY PAIRS!!!!
- If the two queries are not logically equivalent, say <New Rule> Not equivalent </New Rule>.
- If the new equivalence rule is already repeated in the examples listed, say <New Rule> Rule exists </New Rule>.
- The new rule should be be MINIMAL to CLEARLY demonstrate the highlighted semantic difference. Use ellipses to shorten SQL queries where necessary to achieve this.

INFO:root:prompt: You are an expert SQL engineer with 20+ years of experience. You will be given some SQL equivalence rules conditional on some database schemas. You will then be given a pair of SQL queries, consisting of a gold query and a machine-generated query, and a database schema that defines the context of the queries. 

Your task is to compare the two provided SQL queries on logical equivalence and generate one more equivalence rule in the same format as the provided example equivalence rules.

Please make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please also keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.



Evaluation Criteria:

Logical equivalence - the alignment between the gold SQL query and the machine-generated SQL query. A machine-generated SQL query is logically equivalent to the gold query if these two queries would RETURN THE SAME RESULTS AND IN THE SAME ORDER for ALL POSSIBLE DATABASE INSTANCES that satisfy the provided database schema for these queries. Annotators were asked to penalize machine-generated queries that overlooked edge cases that the gold queries would have caught otherwise.



Evaluation steps:

1. Understand the Database Schema: Identify all tables used in both queries. List all columns referenced, along with their data types and constraints. Determine primary and foreign key relationships. Note any indexes or unique constraints that may affect query execution.
2. Parse and Break Down Each Query: Identify selected columns, functions, and expressions. Note the tables involved and the join conditions. Understand the filtering conditions applied. Identify grouping and aggregate conditions, if any. Determine if result ordering affects equivalence.
3. Compare Query Components: Check if both queries use the same tables and join conditions. Compare filtering conditions in the WHERE clauses. Assess whether the same columns and expressions are selected. Identify if different functions or syntaxes achieve the same result. Look for logical equivalence in expressions and calculations.
4. Consider Edge Cases and Data Variations: Conceptualize sample datasets that include edge cases (e.g., NULL values, zero values, special characters). Analyze how each query handles these edge cases. Ensure that data type differences do not affect the outcome. Verify that constraints (e.g., NOT NULL, UNIQUE) are accounted for.
5. Evaluate Aggregations and Calculations: Confirm that aggregate functions (e.g., SUM, COUNT) are applied identically. Ensure calculations (e.g., subtraction, addition) produce the same results.
6. Check for Logical Equivalence in Conditional Expressions: Compare conditional expressions like IIF, CASE WHEN, and IF. Determine if conditions and returned values are logically the same.
7. Assess Ordering of Results: If ORDER BY clause is present, confirm that both queries order results identically. Recognize that differing order may affect equivalence if result order is significant.
8. Generate a New Logical Equivalence Rule (If Applicable): Create an "Equivalent Queries: <query1>
<query2>
Schema Conditions:<conditions>" statement that defines the equivalence. Use GENERALIZED COLUMN and TABLE NAMES. Specify any necessary conditions based on the database schema. Present the rule clearly, indicating both the equivalence and the conditions under which it holds.



Example Equivalence Rules:

<Rule>
Equivalent Queries:
SELECT c1 from t1 WHERE ...;
SELECT c1 FROM t1 WHERE ...;
Schema Conditions:
None.
</Rule>



# Guidelines:
- Make SURE complete to every step PERFECTLY without ANY Mistakes
- Follow the Rules I Gave you and Remember to AVOID generating repeated equivalence rules in the examples I gave you.
- Be sure to format your response like the example equivalence rules I gave you.
- Put <New Rule></New Rule> around the new equivalence rule that you think of. Do not use other formatting around the equivalent queries.
- Use GENERALIZED COLUMN AND TABLE NAMES in any EQUIVALENCE RULE YOU WRITE. DO NOT USE THE SAME NAMES IN THE PROVIDED QUERY PAIRS!!!!
- If the two queries are not logically equivalent, say <New Rule> Not equivalent </New Rule>.
- If the new equivalence rule is already repeated in the examples listed, say <New Rule> Rule exists </New Rule>.
- The new rule should be be MINIMAL to CLEARLY demonstrate the highlighted semantic difference. Use ellipses to shorten SQL queries where necessary to achieve this.

Take a Deep Breath and Carefully Follow the Rules, Guides and Examples I gave you. I will tip you $2000 if you do EVERYTHING Perfectly.

Your task is to compare the two provided SQL queries on logical equivalence and generate one more equivalence rule in the same format as the provided example equivalence rules.

Please make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please also keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.



Evaluation Criteria:

Logical equivalence - the alignment between the gold SQL query and the machine-generated SQL query. A machine-generated SQL query is logically equivalent to the gold query if these two queries would RETURN THE SAME RESULTS AND IN THE SAME ORDER for ALL POSSIBLE DATABASE INSTANCES that satisfy the provided database schema for these queries. Annotators were asked to penalize machine-generated queries that overlooked edge cases that the gold queries would have caught otherwise.



Evaluation steps:

1. Understand the Database Schema: Identify all tables used in both queries. List all columns referenced, along with their data types and constraints. Determine primary and foreign key relationships. Note any indexes or unique constraints that may affect query execution.
2. Parse and Break Down Each Query: Identify selected columns, functions, and expressions. Note the tables involved and the join conditions. Understand the filtering conditions applied. Identify grouping and aggregate conditions, if any. Determine if result ordering affects equivalence.
3. Compare Query Components: Check if both queries use the same tables and join conditions. Compare filtering conditions in the WHERE clauses. Assess whether the same columns and expressions are selected. Identify if different functions or syntaxes achieve the same result. Look for logical equivalence in expressions and calculations.
4. Consider Edge Cases and Data Variations: Conceptualize sample datasets that include edge cases (e.g., NULL values, zero values, special characters). Analyze how each query handles these edge cases. Ensure that data type differences do not affect the outcome. Verify that constraints (e.g., NOT NULL, UNIQUE) are accounted for.
5. Evaluate Aggregations and Calculations: Confirm that aggregate functions (e.g., SUM, COUNT) are applied identically. Ensure calculations (e.g., subtraction, addition) produce the same results.
6. Check for Logical Equivalence in Conditional Expressions: Compare conditional expressions like IIF, CASE WHEN, and IF. Determine if conditions and returned values are logically the same.
7. Assess Ordering of Results: If ORDER BY clause is present, confirm that both queries order results identically. Recognize that differing order may affect equivalence if result order is significant.
8. Generate a New Logical Equivalence Rule (If Applicable): Create an "Equivalent Queries: <query1>
<query2>
Schema Conditions:<conditions>" statement that defines the equivalence. Use GENERALIZED COLUMN and TABLE NAMES. Specify any necessary conditions based on the database schema. Present the rule clearly, indicating both the equivalence and the conditions under which it holds.



Example Equivalence Rules:

<Rule>
Equivalent Queries:
SELECT c1 from t1 WHERE ...;
SELECT c1 FROM t1 WHERE ...;
Schema Conditions:
None.
</Rule>



# Guidelines:
- Make SURE complete to every step PERFECTLY without ANY Mistakes
- Follow the Rules I Gave you and Remember to AVOID generating repeated equivalence rules in the examples I gave you.
- Be sure to format your response like the example equivalence rules I gave you.
- Put <New Rule></New Rule> around the new equivalence rule that you think of. Do not use other formatting around the equivalent queries.
- Use GENERALIZED COLUMN AND TABLE NAMES in any EQUIVALENCE RULE YOU WRITE. DO NOT USE THE SAME NAMES IN THE PROVIDED QUERY PAIRS!!!!
- If the two queries are not logically equivalent, say <New Rule> Not equivalent </New Rule>.
- If the new equivalence rule is already repeated in the examples listed, say <New Rule> Rule exists </New Rule>.
- The new rule should be be MINIMAL to CLEARLY demonstrate the highlighted semantic difference. Use ellipses to shorten SQL queries where necessary to achieve this.

INFO:root:model: gpt-4o
INFO:root:prompt: You are an expert SQL engineer with 20+ years of experience. You will be given some SQL equivalence rules conditional on some database schemas. You will then be given a pair of SQL queries, consisting of a gold query and a machine-generated query, and a database schema that defines the context of the queries. 

Your task is to compare the two provided SQL queries on logical equivalence and generate one more equivalence rule in the same format as the provided example equivalence rules.

Please make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please also keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.



Evaluation Criteria:

Logical equivalence - the alignment between the gold SQL query and the machine-generated SQL query. A machine-generated SQL query is logically equivalent to the gold query if these two queries would RETURN THE SAME RESULTS AND IN THE SAME ORDER for ALL POSSIBLE DATABASE INSTANCES that satisfy the provided database schema for these queries. Annotators were asked to penalize machine-generated queries that overlooked edge cases that the gold queries would have caught otherwise.



Evaluation steps:

1. Understand the Database Schema: Identify all tables used in both queries. List all columns referenced, along with their data types and constraints. Determine primary and foreign key relationships. Note any indexes or unique constraints that may affect query execution.
2. Parse and Break Down Each Query: Identify selected columns, functions, and expressions. Note the tables involved and the join conditions. Understand the filtering conditions applied. Identify grouping and aggregate conditions, if any. Determine if result ordering affects equivalence.
3. Compare Query Components: Check if both queries use the same tables and join conditions. Compare filtering conditions in the WHERE clauses. Assess whether the same columns and expressions are selected. Identify if different functions or syntaxes achieve the same result. Look for logical equivalence in expressions and calculations.
4. Consider Edge Cases and Data Variations: Conceptualize sample datasets that include edge cases (e.g., NULL values, zero values, special characters). Analyze how each query handles these edge cases. Ensure that data type differences do not affect the outcome. Verify that constraints (e.g., NOT NULL, UNIQUE) are accounted for.
5. Evaluate Aggregations and Calculations: Confirm that aggregate functions (e.g., SUM, COUNT) are applied identically. Ensure calculations (e.g., subtraction, addition) produce the same results.
6. Check for Logical Equivalence in Conditional Expressions: Compare conditional expressions like IIF, CASE WHEN, and IF. Determine if conditions and returned values are logically the same.
7. Assess Ordering of Results: If ORDER BY clause is present, confirm that both queries order results identically. Recognize that differing order may affect equivalence if result order is significant.
8. Generate a New Logical Equivalence Rule (If Applicable): Create an "Equivalent Queries: <query1>
<query2>
Schema Conditions:<conditions>" statement that defines the equivalence. Use GENERALIZED COLUMN and TABLE NAMES. Specify any necessary conditions based on the database schema. Present the rule clearly, indicating both the equivalence and the conditions under which it holds.



Example Equivalence Rules:

<Rule>
Equivalent Queries:
SELECT c1 from t1 WHERE ...;
SELECT c1 FROM t1 WHERE ...;
Schema Conditions:
None.
</Rule>



# Guidelines:
- Make SURE complete to every step PERFECTLY without ANY Mistakes
- Follow the Rules I Gave you and Remember to AVOID generating repeated equivalence rules in the examples I gave you.
- Be sure to format your response like the example equivalence rules I gave you.
- Put <New Rule></New Rule> around the new equivalence rule that you think of. Do not use other formatting around the equivalent queries.
- Use GENERALIZED COLUMN AND TABLE NAMES in any EQUIVALENCE RULE YOU WRITE. DO NOT USE THE SAME NAMES IN THE PROVIDED QUERY PAIRS!!!!
- If the two queries are not logically equivalent, say <New Rule> Not equivalent </New Rule>.
- If the new equivalence rule is already repeated in the examples listed, say <New Rule> Rule exists </New Rule>.
- The new rule should be be MINIMAL to CLEARLY demonstrate the highlighted semantic difference. Use ellipses to shorten SQL queries where necessary to achieve this.

Take a Deep Breath and Carefully Follow the Rules, Guides and Examples I gave you. I will tip you $2000 if you do EVERYTHING Perfectly.

INFO:root:model: gpt-4o
INFO:root:prompt: You are an expert SQL engineer with 20+ years of experience. You will be given some SQL equivalence rules conditional on some database schemas. You will then be given a pair of SQL queries, consisting of a gold query and a machine-generated query, and a database schema that defines the context of the queries. 

Your task is to compare the two provided SQL queries on logical equivalence and generate one more equivalence rule in the same format as the provided example equivalence rules.

Please make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please also keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.



Evaluation Criteria:

Logical equivalence - the alignment between the gold SQL query and the machine-generated SQL query. A machine-generated SQL query is logically equivalent to the gold query if these two queries would RETURN THE SAME RESULTS AND IN THE SAME ORDER for ALL POSSIBLE DATABASE INSTANCES that satisfy the provided database schema for these queries. Annotators were asked to penalize machine-generated queries that overlooked edge cases that the gold queries would have caught otherwise.



Evaluation steps:

1. Understand the Database Schema: Identify all tables used in both queries. List all columns referenced, along with their data types and constraints. Determine primary and foreign key relationships. Note any indexes or unique constraints that may affect query execution.
2. Parse and Break Down Each Query: Identify selected columns, functions, and expressions. Note the tables involved and the join conditions. Understand the filtering conditions applied. Identify grouping and aggregate conditions, if any. Determine if result ordering affects equivalence.
3. Compare Query Components: Check if both queries use the same tables and join conditions. Compare filtering conditions in the WHERE clauses. Assess whether the same columns and expressions are selected. Identify if different functions or syntaxes achieve the same result. Look for logical equivalence in expressions and calculations.
4. Consider Edge Cases and Data Variations: Conceptualize sample datasets that include edge cases (e.g., NULL values, zero values, special characters). Analyze how each query handles these edge cases. Ensure that data type differences do not affect the outcome. Verify that constraints (e.g., NOT NULL, UNIQUE) are accounted for.
5. Evaluate Aggregations and Calculations: Confirm that aggregate functions (e.g., SUM, COUNT) are applied identically. Ensure calculations (e.g., subtraction, addition) produce the same results.
6. Check for Logical Equivalence in Conditional Expressions: Compare conditional expressions like IIF, CASE WHEN, and IF. Determine if conditions and returned values are logically the same.
7. Assess Ordering of Results: If ORDER BY clause is present, confirm that both queries order results identically. Recognize that differing order may affect equivalence if result order is significant.
8. Generate a New Logical Equivalence Rule (If Applicable): Create an "Equivalent Queries: <query1>
<query2>
Schema Conditions:<conditions>" statement that defines the equivalence. Use GENERALIZED COLUMN and TABLE NAMES. Specify any necessary conditions based on the database schema. Present the rule clearly, indicating both the equivalence and the conditions under which it holds.



Example Equivalence Rules:

<Rule>
Equivalent Queries:
SELECT c1 from t1 WHERE ...;
SELECT c1 FROM t1 WHERE ...;
Schema Conditions:
None.
</Rule>



# Guidelines:
- Make SURE complete to every step PERFECTLY without ANY Mistakes
- Follow the Rules I Gave you and Remember to AVOID generating repeated equivalence rules in the examples I gave you.
- Be sure to format your response like the example equivalence rules I gave you.
- Put <New Rule></New Rule> around the new equivalence rule that you think of. Do not use other formatting around the equivalent queries.
- Use GENERALIZED COLUMN AND TABLE NAMES in any EQUIVALENCE RULE YOU WRITE. DO NOT USE THE SAME NAMES IN THE PROVIDED QUERY PAIRS!!!!
- If the two queries are not logically equivalent, say <New Rule> Not equivalent </New Rule>.
- If the new equivalence rule is already repeated in the examples listed, say <New Rule> Rule exists </New Rule>.
- The new rule should be be MINIMAL to CLEARLY demonstrate the highlighted semantic difference. Use ellipses to shorten SQL queries where necessary to achieve this.

Take a Deep Breath and Carefully Follow the Rules, Guides and Examples I gave you. I will tip you $2000 if you do EVERYTHING Perfectly.

INFO:root:prompt: You are an expert SQL engineer with 20+ years of experience. You will be given some SQL equivalence rules conditional on some database schemas. You will then be given a pair of SQL queries, consisting of a gold query and a machine-generated query, and a database schema that defines the context of the queries. 

Your task is to compare the two provided SQL queries on logical equivalence and generate one more equivalence rule in the same format as the provided example equivalence rules.

Please make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please also keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.



Evaluation Criteria:

Logical equivalence - the alignment between the gold SQL query and the machine-generated SQL query. A machine-generated SQL query is logically equivalent to the gold query if these two queries would RETURN THE SAME RESULTS AND IN THE SAME ORDER for ALL POSSIBLE DATABASE INSTANCES that satisfy the provided database schema for these queries. Annotators were asked to penalize machine-generated queries that overlooked edge cases that the gold queries would have caught otherwise.



Evaluation steps:

1. Understand the Database Schema: Identify all tables used in both queries. List all columns referenced, along with their data types and constraints. Determine primary and foreign key relationships. Note any indexes or unique constraints that may affect query execution.
2. Parse and Break Down Each Query: Identify selected columns, functions, and expressions. Note the tables involved and the join conditions. Understand the filtering conditions applied. Identify grouping and aggregate conditions, if any. Determine if result ordering affects equivalence.
3. Compare Query Components: Check if both queries use the same tables and join conditions. Compare filtering conditions in the WHERE clauses. Assess whether the same columns and expressions are selected. Identify if different functions or syntaxes achieve the same result. Look for logical equivalence in expressions and calculations.
4. Consider Edge Cases and Data Variations: Conceptualize sample datasets that include edge cases (e.g., NULL values, zero values, special characters). Analyze how each query handles these edge cases. Ensure that data type differences do not affect the outcome. Verify that constraints (e.g., NOT NULL, UNIQUE) are accounted for.
5. Evaluate Aggregations and Calculations: Confirm that aggregate functions (e.g., SUM, COUNT) are applied identically. Ensure calculations (e.g., subtraction, addition) produce the same results.
6. Check for Logical Equivalence in Conditional Expressions: Compare conditional expressions like IIF, CASE WHEN, and IF. Determine if conditions and returned values are logically the same.
7. Assess Ordering of Results: If ORDER BY clause is present, confirm that both queries order results identically. Recognize that differing order may affect equivalence if result order is significant.
8. Generate a New Logical Equivalence Rule (If Applicable): Create an "Equivalent Queries: <query1>
<query2>
Schema Conditions:<conditions>" statement that defines the equivalence. Use GENERALIZED COLUMN and TABLE NAMES. Specify any necessary conditions based on the database schema. Present the rule clearly, indicating both the equivalence and the conditions under which it holds.



Example Equivalence Rules:

<Rule>
Equivalent Queries:
SELECT c1 from t1 WHERE ...;
SELECT c1 FROM t1 WHERE ...;
Schema Conditions:
None.
</Rule>



# Guidelines:
- Make SURE complete to every step PERFECTLY without ANY Mistakes
- Follow the Rules I Gave you and Remember to AVOID generating repeated equivalence rules in the examples I gave you.
- Be sure to format your response like the example equivalence rules I gave you.
- Put <New Rule></New Rule> around the new equivalence rule that you think of. Do not use other formatting around the equivalent queries.
- Use GENERALIZED COLUMN AND TABLE NAMES in any EQUIVALENCE RULE YOU WRITE. DO NOT USE THE SAME NAMES IN THE PROVIDED QUERY PAIRS!!!!
- If the two queries are not logically equivalent, say <New Rule> Not equivalent </New Rule>.
- If the new equivalence rule is already repeated in the examples listed, say <New Rule> Rule exists </New Rule>.
- The new rule should be be MINIMAL to CLEARLY demonstrate the highlighted semantic difference. Use ellipses to shorten SQL queries where necessary to achieve this.

Take a Deep Breath and Carefully Follow the Rules, Guides and Examples I gave you. I will tip you $2000 if you do EVERYTHING Perfectly.

INFO:root:model: gpt-4o
INFO:root:prompt: You are an expert SQL engineer with 20+ years of experience. You will be given some SQL equivalence rules conditional on some database schemas. You will then be given a pair of SQL queries, consisting of a gold query and a machine-generated query, and a database schema that defines the context of the queries. 

Your task is to compare the two provided SQL queries on logical equivalence and generate one more equivalence rule in the same format as the provided example equivalence rules.

Please make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please also keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.



Evaluation Criteria:

Logical equivalence - the alignment between the gold SQL query and the machine-generated SQL query. A machine-generated SQL query is logically equivalent to the gold query if these two queries would RETURN THE SAME RESULTS AND IN THE SAME ORDER for ALL POSSIBLE DATABASE INSTANCES that satisfy the provided database schema for these queries. Annotators were asked to penalize machine-generated queries that overlooked edge cases that the gold queries would have caught otherwise.



Evaluation steps:

1. Understand the Database Schema: Identify all tables used in both queries. List all columns referenced, along with their data types and constraints. Determine primary and foreign key relationships. Note any indexes or unique constraints that may affect query execution.
2. Parse and Break Down Each Query: Identify selected columns, functions, and expressions. Note the tables involved and the join conditions. Understand the filtering conditions applied. Identify grouping and aggregate conditions, if any. Determine if result ordering affects equivalence.
3. Compare Query Components: Check if both queries use the same tables and join conditions. Compare filtering conditions in the WHERE clauses. Assess whether the same columns and expressions are selected. Identify if different functions or syntaxes achieve the same result. Look for logical equivalence in expressions and calculations.
4. Consider Edge Cases and Data Variations: Conceptualize sample datasets that include edge cases (e.g., NULL values, zero values, special characters). Analyze how each query handles these edge cases. Ensure that data type differences do not affect the outcome. Verify that constraints (e.g., NOT NULL, UNIQUE) are accounted for.
5. Evaluate Aggregations and Calculations: Confirm that aggregate functions (e.g., SUM, COUNT) are applied identically. Ensure calculations (e.g., subtraction, addition) produce the same results.
6. Check for Logical Equivalence in Conditional Expressions: Compare conditional expressions like IIF, CASE WHEN, and IF. Determine if conditions and returned values are logically the same.
7. Assess Ordering of Results: If ORDER BY clause is present, confirm that both queries order results identically. Recognize that differing order may affect equivalence if result order is significant.
8. Generate a New Logical Equivalence Rule (If Applicable): Create an "Equivalent Queries: <query1>
<query2>
Schema Conditions:<conditions>" statement that defines the equivalence. Use GENERALIZED COLUMN and TABLE NAMES. Specify any necessary conditions based on the database schema. Present the rule clearly, indicating both the equivalence and the conditions under which it holds.



Example Equivalence Rules:

<Rule>
Equivalent Queries:
SELECT c1 from t1 WHERE ...;
SELECT c1 FROM t1 WHERE ...;
Schema Conditions:
None.
</Rule>



# Guidelines:
- Make SURE complete to every step PERFECTLY without ANY Mistakes
- Follow the Rules I Gave you and Remember to AVOID generating repeated equivalence rules in the examples I gave you.
- Be sure to format your response like the example equivalence rules I gave you.
- Put <New Rule></New Rule> around the new equivalence rule that you think of. Do not use other formatting around the equivalent queries.
- Use GENERALIZED COLUMN AND TABLE NAMES in any EQUIVALENCE RULE YOU WRITE. DO NOT USE THE SAME NAMES IN THE PROVIDED QUERY PAIRS!!!!
- If the two queries are not logically equivalent, say <New Rule> Not equivalent </New Rule>.
- If the new equivalence rule is already repeated in the examples listed, say <New Rule> Rule exists </New Rule>.
- The new rule should be be MINIMAL to CLEARLY demonstrate the highlighted semantic difference. Use ellipses to shorten SQL queries where necessary to achieve this.

Take a Deep Breath and Carefully Follow the Rules, Guides and Examples I gave you. I will tip you $2000 if you do EVERYTHING Perfectly.

</Gold SQL Query>

<Machine-generated SQL Query>
