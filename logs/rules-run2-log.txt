INFO:root:prompt: You are an expert SQL engineer with 20+ years of experience. You will be given some SQL equivalence rules conditional on some database schemas. You will then be given a pair of SQL queries, consisting of a gold query and a machine-generated query, and a database schema that defines the context of the queries. 

Your task is to compare the two provided SQL queries on logical equivalence and generate one more equivalence rule in the same format as the provided example equivalence rules.

Please make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please also keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.



Evaluation Criteria:

Logical equivalence - the alignment between the gold SQL query and the machine-generated SQL query. A machine-generated SQL query is logically equivalent to the gold query if these two queries would RETURN THE SAME RESULTS AND IN THE SAME ORDER for ALL POSSIBLE DATABASE INSTANCES that satisfy the provided database schema for these queries. Annotators were asked to penalize machine-generated queries that overlooked edge cases that the gold queries would have caught otherwise.



Evaluation steps:

1. Understand the Database Schema: Identify all tables used in both queries. List all columns referenced, along with their data types and constraints. Determine primary and foreign key relationships. Note any indexes or unique constraints that may affect query execution.
2. Parse and Break Down Each Query: Identify selected columns, functions, and expressions. Note the tables involved and the join conditions. Understand the filtering conditions applied. Identify grouping and aggregate conditions, if any. Determine if result ordering affects equivalence.
3. Compare Query Components: Check if both queries use the same tables and join conditions. Compare filtering conditions in the WHERE clauses. Assess whether the same columns and expressions are selected. Identify if different functions or syntaxes achieve the same result. Look for logical equivalence in expressions and calculations.
4. Consider Edge Cases and Data Variations: Conceptualize sample datasets that include edge cases (e.g., NULL values, zero values, special characters). Analyze how each query handles these edge cases. Ensure that data type differences do not affect the outcome. Verify that constraints (e.g., NOT NULL, UNIQUE) are accounted for.
5. Evaluate Aggregations and Calculations: Confirm that aggregate functions (e.g., SUM, COUNT) are applied identically. Ensure calculations (e.g., subtraction, addition) produce the same results.
6. Check for Logical Equivalence in Conditional Expressions: Compare conditional expressions like IIF, CASE WHEN, and IF. Determine if conditions and returned values are logically the same.
7. Assess Ordering of Results: If ORDER BY clause is present, confirm that both queries order results identically. Recognize that differing order may affect equivalence if result order is significant.
8. Generate a New Logical Equivalence Rule (If Applicable): Create an "Equivalent Queries: <query1>
<query2>
Schema Conditions:<conditions>" statement that defines the equivalence. Use GENERALIZED COLUMN and TABLE NAMES. Specify any necessary conditions based on the database schema. Present the rule clearly, indicating both the equivalence and the conditions under which it holds.



Example Equivalence Rules:

<Rule>
Equivalent Queries:
SELECT c1 from t1 WHERE ...;
SELECT c1 AS c2 FROM t1 WHERE ...;
Schema Conditions:
None.
</Rule>



# Guidelines:
- Make SURE complete to every step PERFECTLY without ANY Mistakes
- Follow the Rules I Gave you and Remember to AVOID generating repeated equivalence rules in the examples I gave you.
- Be sure to format your response like the example equivalence rules I gave you.
- Put <New Rule></New Rule> around the new equivalence rule that you think of. Do not use other formatting around the equivalent queries.
- Use GENERALIZED COLUMN AND TABLE NAMES in any EQUIVALENCE RULE YOU WRITE. DO NOT USE THE SAME NAMES IN THE PROVIDED QUERY PAIRS!!!!
- If the two queries are not logically equivalent, say <New Rule> Not equivalent </New Rule>.
- If the new equivalence rule is already repeated in the examples listed, say <New Rule> Rule exists </New Rule>.
- The new rule should be be minimal to CLEARLY demonstrate the highlighted semantic difference. Use ellipses to shorten SQL queries where necessary to achieve this.

Take a Deep Breath and Carefully Follow the Rules, Guides and Examples I gave you. I will tip you $2000 if you do EVERYTHING Perfectly.

Assess whether the same columns and expressions are selected. Identify if different functions or syntaxes achieve the same result. Look for logical equivalence in expressions and calculations.
4. Consider Edge Cases and Data Variations: Conceptualize sample datasets that include edge cases (e.g., NULL values, zero values, special characters). Analyze how each query handles these edge cases. Ensure that data type differences do not affect the outcome. Verify that constraints (e.g., NOT NULL, UNIQUE) are accounted for.
5. Evaluate Aggregations and Calculations: Confirm that aggregate functions (e.g., SUM, COUNT) are applied identically. Ensure calculations (e.g., subtraction, addition) produce the same results.
6. Check for Logical Equivalence in Conditional Expressions: Compare conditional expressions like IIF, CASE WHEN, and IF. Determine if conditions and returned values are logically the same.
7. Assess Ordering of Results: If ORDER BY clause is present, confirm that both queries order results identically. Recognize that differing order may affect equivalence if result order is significant.
8. Generate a New Logical Equivalence Rule (If Applicable): Create an "Equivalent Queries: <query1>
<query2>
Schema Conditions:<conditions>" statement that defines the equivalence. Use GENERALIZED COLUMN and TABLE NAMES. Specify any necessary conditions based on the database schema. Present the rule clearly, indicating both the equivalence and the conditions under which it holds.



Example Equivalence Rules:

<Rule1>
Equivalent Queries:
SELECT SUM(IIF(condition1, expr1, 0)) - SUM(IIF(condition2, expr2, 0)) FROM table;
SELECT SUM(CASE WHEN condition1 THEN expr1 ELSE 0 END) - SUM(CASE WHEN condition2 THEN expr2 ELSE 0 END) FROM table;
Schema Conditions:
None.
</Rule1>

<Rule2>
Equivalent Queries:
SELECT CAST(SUM(IIF(condition, 1, 0)) AS FLOAT) / SUM(IIF(condition, 1, 0)) FROM table;
SELECT CAST(SUM(CASE WHEN condition THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS REAL) / SUM(CASE WHEN condition THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) FROM table;
Schema Conditions:
None.
</Rule2>



# Guidelines:
- Make SURE complete to every step PERFECTLY without ANY Mistakes
- Follow the Rules I Gave you and Remember to AVOID generating repeated equivalence rules in the examples I gave you.
- Be sure to format your response like the example equivalence rules I gave you.
- Put <New Rule></New Rule> around the new equivalence rule that you think of. Do not use other formatting around the equivalent queries.
- Use GENERALIZED COLUMN AND TABLE NAMES in any EQUIVALENCE RULE YOU WRITE. DO NOT USE THE SAME NAMES IN THE PROVIDED QUERY PAIRS!!!!
- If the two queries are not logically equivalent, say <New Rule> Not equivalent </New Rule>.
- If the new equivalence rule is already repeated in the examples listed, say <New Rule> Rule exists </New Rule>.
- The new rule should be be minimal to CLEARLY demonstrate the highlighted semantic difference. Use ellipses to shorten SQL queries where necessary to achieve this.

You will then be given a pair of SQL queries, consisting of a gold query and a machine-generated query, and a database schema that defines the context of the queries. 

Your task is to compare the two provided SQL queries on logical equivalence and generate one more equivalence rule in the same format as the provided example equivalence rules.

Please make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please also keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.

Let's break down the process:\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Database Schema\n\n**Tables Involved:**\n- `customers`\n  - Columns: `CustomerID` (INTEGER, PRIMARY KEY), `Segment` (TEXT), `Currency` (TEXT)\n- `yearmonth`\n  - Columns: `CustomerID` (INTEGER, FOREIGN KEY referencing `customers`), `Date` (TEXT), `Consumption` (REAL)\n\n**Key Relationships:**\n- `yearmonth.CustomerID` references `customers.CustomerID`.\n\n### Step 2: Parse and Break Down Each Query\n\n**Gold SQL Query:**\n```sql\nSELECT COUNT(*) \nFROM yearmonth AS T1 \nINNER JOIN customers AS T2 \nON T1.CustomerID = T2.CustomerID \nWHERE T2.Currency = 'EUR' AND T1.Consumption > 1000.00;\n```\n- **Selected Columns:** COUNT(*)\n- **Tables Involved:** `yearmonth` (aliased as T1), `customers` (aliased as T2)\n- **Join Condition:** `T1.CustomerID = T2.CustomerID`\n- **Filtering Conditions:** `T2.Currency = 'EUR'`, `T1.Consumption > 1000.00`\n\n**Machine-generated SQL Query:**\n```sql\nSELECT count(yearmonth.customerid) \nFROM customers \nINNER JOIN yearmonth \nON customers.customerid = yearmonth.customerid \nWHERE customers.currency = 'EUR' AND yearmonth.consumption > 1000;\n```\n- **Selected Columns:** count(yearmonth.customerid)\n- **Tables Involved:** `customers`, `yearmonth`\n- **Join Condition:** `customers.customerid = yearmonth.customerid`\n- **Filtering Conditions:** `customers.currency = 'EUR'`, `yearmonth.consumption > 1000`\n\n### Step 3: Compare Query Components\n\n- Both queries use the same tables (`customers` and `yearmonth`) and join them on the same condition (`CustomerID`).\n- The filtering conditions are identical in both queries.\n- The selected columns differ in syntax but are logically equivalent: `COUNT(*)` vs. `count(yearmonth.customerid)`. Since the join condition ensures that each `CustomerID` in `yearmonth` corresponds to a `CustomerID` in `customers`, counting either `*` or `yearmonth.customerid` will yield the same result.\n\n### Step 4: Consider Edge Cases and Data Variations\n\n- **NULL Values:** `CustomerID` is a primary key in `customers` and a foreign key in `yearmonth`, so there are no NULLs in these columns.\n- **Data Types:** The `Consumption` column is of type REAL, but both queries handle it consistently.\n\n### Step 5: Evaluate Aggregations and Calculations\n\n- Both queries use the `COUNT` function, which is applied identically.\n\n### Step 6: Check for Logical Equivalence in Conditional Expressions\n\n- The conditional expressions in the WHERE clause are identical.\n\n### Step 7: Assess Ordering of Results\n\n- Neither query specifies an `ORDER BY` clause, so result ordering is not a factor.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe two queries are logically equivalent. They perform the same join, apply the same filters, and count the same set of rows. The difference in syntax between `COUNT(*)` and `count(yearmonth.customerid)` does not affect the result.\n\n### Step 8: Generate a New Logical Equivalence Rule\n\n<New Rule>\nEquivalent Queries:\nSELECT COUNT(*) FROM table1 INNER JOIN table2 ON table1.col1 = table2.col2 WHERE condition;\nSELECT COUNT(table1.col1) FROM table2 INNER JOIN table1 ON table2.col2 = table1.col1 WHERE condition;\nSchema Conditions:\ntable1.col1 is a non-nullable column that uniquely identifies rows in table1.\n", role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None, refusal=None))], created=1730774759, model='gpt-4o-2024-08-06', object='chat.completion', system_fingerprint='fp_45cf54deae', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=810, prompt_tokens=1382, total_tokens=2192, prompt_tokens_details={'cached_tokens': 0}, completion_tokens_details={'reasoning_tokens': 0, 'accepted_prediction_tokens': 0, 'rejected_prediction_tokens': 0}))

INFO:root:prompt: You are an expert SQL engineer with 20+ years of experience. You will be given some SQL equivalence rules conditional on some database schemas. You will then be given a pair of SQL queries, consisting of a gold query and a machine-generated query, and a database schema that defines the context of the queries. 

Your task is to compare the two provided SQL queries on logical equivalence and generate one more equivalence rule in the same format as the provided example equivalence rules.

Please make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please also keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.



Evaluation Criteria:

Logical equivalence - the alignment between the gold SQL query and the machine-generated SQL query. A machine-generated SQL query is logically equivalent to the gold query if these two queries would RETURN THE SAME RESULTS AND IN THE SAME ORDER for ALL POSSIBLE DATABASE INSTANCES that satisfy the provided database schema for these queries. Annotators were asked to penalize machine-generated queries that overlooked edge cases that the gold queries would have caught otherwise.



Evaluation steps:

1. Understand the Database Schema: Identify all tables used in both queries. List all columns referenced, along with their data types and constraints. Determine primary and foreign key relationships. Note any indexes or unique constraints that may affect query execution.
2. Parse and Break Down Each Query: Identify selected columns, functions, and expressions. Note the tables involved and the join conditions. Understand the filtering conditions applied. Identify grouping and aggregate conditions, if any. Determine if result ordering affects equivalence.
3. Compare Query Components: Check if both queries use the same tables and join conditions. Compare filtering conditions in the WHERE clauses. Assess whether the same columns and expressions are selected. Identify if different functions or syntaxes achieve the same result. Look for logical equivalence in expressions and calculations.
4. Consider Edge Cases and Data Variations: Conceptualize sample datasets that include edge cases (e.g., NULL values, zero values, special characters). Analyze how each query handles these edge cases. Ensure that data type differences do not affect the outcome. Verify that constraints (e.g., NOT NULL, UNIQUE) are accounted for.
5. Evaluate Aggregations and Calculations: Confirm that aggregate functions (e.g., SUM, COUNT) are applied identically. Ensure calculations (e.g., subtraction, addition) produce the same results.
6. Check for Logical Equivalence in Conditional Expressions: Compare conditional expressions like IIF, CASE WHEN, and IF. Determine if conditions and returned values are logically the same.
7. Assess Ordering of Results: If ORDER BY clause is present, confirm that both queries order results identically. Recognize that differing order may affect equivalence if result order is significant.
8. Generate a New Logical Equivalence Rule (If Applicable): Create an "Equivalent Queries: <query1>
<query2>
Schema Conditions:<conditions>" statement that defines the equivalence. Use GENERALIZED COLUMN and TABLE NAMES. Specify any necessary conditions based on the database schema. Present the rule clearly, indicating both the equivalence and the conditions under which it holds.



Example Equivalence Rules:

<Rule1>
Equivalent Queries:
SELECT SUM(IIF(condition1, expr1, 0)) - SUM(IIF(condition2, expr2, 0)) FROM table;
SELECT SUM(CASE WHEN condition1 THEN expr1 ELSE 0 END) - SUM(CASE WHEN condition2 THEN expr2 ELSE 0 END) FROM table;
Schema Conditions:
None.
</Rule1>

<Rule2>
Equivalent Queries:
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM table1 INNER JOIN table2 ON table1.col1 = table2.col2 WHERE condition;
SELECT COUNT(table1.col1) FROM table2 INNER JOIN table1 ON table2.col2 = table1.col1 WHERE condition;
Schema Conditions:
table1.col1 is a non-nullable column that uniquely identifies rows in table1.
</Rule2>

<Rule3>
Equivalent Queries:
SELECT CAST(SUM(IIF(condition, 1, 0)) AS FLOAT) / SUM(IIF(condition, 1, 0)) FROM table;
SELECT CAST(SUM(CASE WHEN condition THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS REAL) / SUM(CASE WHEN condition THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) FROM table;
Schema Conditions:
None.
</Rule3>



# Guidelines:
- Make SURE complete to every step PERFECTLY without ANY Mistakes
- Follow the Rules I Gave you and Remember to AVOID generating repeated equivalence rules in the examples I gave you.
- Be sure to format your response like the example equivalence rules I gave you.
- Put <New Rule></New Rule> around the new equivalence rule that you think of. Do not use other formatting around the equivalent queries.
- Use GENERALIZED COLUMN AND TABLE NAMES in any EQUIVALENCE RULE YOU WRITE. DO NOT USE THE SAME NAMES IN THE PROVIDED QUERY PAIRS!!!!
- If the two queries are not logically equivalent, say <New Rule> Not equivalent </New Rule>.
- If the new equivalence rule is already repeated in the examples listed, say <New Rule> Rule exists </New Rule>.
- The new rule should be be minimal to CLEARLY demonstrate the highlighted semantic difference. Use ellipses to shorten SQL queries where necessary to achieve this.

Take a Deep Breath and Carefully Follow the Rules, Guides and Examples I gave you. I will tip you $2000 if you do EVERYTHING Perfectly.

INFO:root:prompt: You are an expert SQL engineer with 20+ years of experience. You will be given some SQL equivalence rules conditional on some database schemas. You will then be given a pair of SQL queries, consisting of a gold query and a machine-generated query, and a database schema that defines the context of the queries. 

Your task is to compare the two provided SQL queries on logical equivalence and generate one more equivalence rule in the same format as the provided example equivalence rules.

Please make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please also keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.



Evaluation Criteria:

Logical equivalence - the alignment between the gold SQL query and the machine-generated SQL query. A machine-generated SQL query is logically equivalent to the gold query if these two queries would RETURN THE SAME RESULTS AND IN THE SAME ORDER for ALL POSSIBLE DATABASE INSTANCES that satisfy the provided database schema for these queries. Annotators were asked to penalize machine-generated queries that overlooked edge cases that the gold queries would have caught otherwise.



Evaluation steps:

1. Understand the Database Schema: Identify all tables used in both queries. List all columns referenced, along with their data types and constraints. Determine primary and foreign key relationships. Note any indexes or unique constraints that may affect query execution.
2. Parse and Break Down Each Query: Identify selected columns, functions, and expressions. Note the tables involved and the join conditions. Understand the filtering conditions applied. Identify grouping and aggregate conditions, if any. Determine if result ordering affects equivalence.
3. Compare Query Components: Check if both queries use the same tables and join conditions. Compare filtering conditions in the WHERE clauses. Assess whether the same columns and expressions are selected. Identify if different functions or syntaxes achieve the same result. Look for logical equivalence in expressions and calculations.
4. Consider Edge Cases and Data Variations: Conceptualize sample datasets that include edge cases (e.g., NULL values, zero values, special characters). Analyze how each query handles these edge cases. Ensure that data type differences do not affect the outcome. Verify that constraints (e.g., NOT NULL, UNIQUE) are accounted for.
5. Evaluate Aggregations and Calculations: Confirm that aggregate functions (e.g., SUM, COUNT) are applied identically. Ensure calculations (e.g., subtraction, addition) produce the same results.
6. Check for Logical Equivalence in Conditional Expressions: Compare conditional expressions like IIF, CASE WHEN, and IF. Determine if conditions and returned values are logically the same.
7. Assess Ordering of Results: If ORDER BY clause is present, confirm that both queries order results identically. Recognize that differing order may affect equivalence if result order is significant.
8. Generate a New Logical Equivalence Rule (If Applicable): Create an "Equivalent Queries: <query1>
<query2>
Schema Conditions:<conditions>" statement that defines the equivalence. Use GENERALIZED COLUMN and TABLE NAMES. Specify any necessary conditions based on the database schema. Present the rule clearly, indicating both the equivalence and the conditions under which it holds.



Example Equivalence Rules:

<Rule1>
Equivalent Queries:
SELECT SUM(IIF(condition1, expr1, 0)) - SUM(IIF(condition2, expr2, 0)) FROM table;
SELECT SUM(CASE WHEN condition1 THEN expr1 ELSE 0 END) - SUM(CASE WHEN condition2 THEN expr2 ELSE 0 END) FROM table;
Schema Conditions:
None.
</Rule1>

<Rule2>
Equivalent Queries:
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM table1 INNER JOIN table2 ON table1.col1 = table2.col2 WHERE condition;
SELECT COUNT(table1.col1) FROM table2 INNER JOIN table1 ON table2.col2 = table1.col1 WHERE condition;
Schema Conditions:
table1.col1 is a non-nullable column that uniquely identifies rows in table1.
</Rule2>

<Rule3>
Equivalent Queries:
SELECT CAST(SUM(IIF(condition, 1, 0)) AS FLOAT) / SUM(IIF(condition, 1, 0)) FROM table;
SELECT CAST(SUM(CASE WHEN condition THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS REAL) / SUM(CASE WHEN condition THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) FROM table;
Schema Conditions:
None.
</Rule3>



# Guidelines:
- Make SURE complete to every step PERFECTLY without ANY Mistakes
- Follow the Rules I Gave you and Remember to AVOID generating repeated equivalence rules in the examples I gave you.
- Be sure to format your response like the example equivalence rules I gave you.
- Put <New Rule></New Rule> around the new equivalence rule that you think of. Do not use other formatting around the equivalent queries.
- Use GENERALIZED COLUMN AND TABLE NAMES in any EQUIVALENCE RULE YOU WRITE. DO NOT USE THE SAME NAMES IN THE PROVIDED QUERY PAIRS!!!!
- If the two queries are not logically equivalent, say <New Rule> Not equivalent </New Rule>.
- If the new equivalence rule is already repeated in the examples listed, say <New Rule> Rule exists </New Rule>.
- The new rule should be be minimal to CLEARLY demonstrate the highlighted semantic difference. Use ellipses to shorten SQL queries where necessary to achieve this.

INFO:root:prompt: You are an expert SQL engineer with 20+ years of experience. You will be given some SQL equivalence rules conditional on some database schemas. You will then be given a pair of SQL queries, consisting of a gold query and a machine-generated query, and a database schema that defines the context of the queries. 

Your task is to compare the two provided SQL queries on logical equivalence and generate one more equivalence rule in the same format as the provided example equivalence rules.

Please make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please also keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.



Evaluation Criteria:

Logical equivalence - the alignment between the gold SQL query and the machine-generated SQL query. A machine-generated SQL query is logically equivalent to the gold query if these two queries would RETURN THE SAME RESULTS AND IN THE SAME ORDER for ALL POSSIBLE DATABASE INSTANCES that satisfy the provided database schema for these queries. Annotators were asked to penalize machine-generated queries that overlooked edge cases that the gold queries would have caught otherwise.



Evaluation steps:

1. Understand the Database Schema: Identify all tables used in both queries. List all columns referenced, along with their data types and constraints. Determine primary and foreign key relationships. Note any indexes or unique constraints that may affect query execution.
2. Parse and Break Down Each Query: Identify selected columns, functions, and expressions. Note the tables involved and the join conditions. Understand the filtering conditions applied. Identify grouping and aggregate conditions, if any. Determine if result ordering affects equivalence.
3. Compare Query Components: Check if both queries use the same tables and join conditions. Compare filtering conditions in the WHERE clauses. Assess whether the same columns and expressions are selected. Identify if different functions or syntaxes achieve the same result. Look for logical equivalence in expressions and calculations.
4. Consider Edge Cases and Data Variations: Conceptualize sample datasets that include edge cases (e.g., NULL values, zero values, special characters). Analyze how each query handles these edge cases. Ensure that data type differences do not affect the outcome. Verify that constraints (e.g., NOT NULL, UNIQUE) are accounted for.
5. Evaluate Aggregations and Calculations: Confirm that aggregate functions (e.g., SUM, COUNT) are applied identically. Ensure calculations (e.g., subtraction, addition) produce the same results.
6. Check for Logical Equivalence in Conditional Expressions: Compare conditional expressions like IIF, CASE WHEN, and IF. Determine if conditions and returned values are logically the same.
7. Assess Ordering of Results: If ORDER BY clause is present, confirm that both queries order results identically. Recognize that differing order may affect equivalence if result order is significant.
8. Generate a New Logical Equivalence Rule (If Applicable): Create an "Equivalent Queries: <query1>
<query2>
Schema Conditions:<conditions>" statement that defines the equivalence. Use GENERALIZED COLUMN and TABLE NAMES. Specify any necessary conditions based on the database schema. Present the rule clearly, indicating both the equivalence and the conditions under which it holds.



Example Equivalence Rules:

<Rule1>
Equivalent Queries:
SELECT SUM(IIF(condition1, expr1, 0)) - SUM(IIF(condition2, expr2, 0)) FROM table;
SELECT SUM(CASE WHEN condition1 THEN expr1 ELSE 0 END) - SUM(CASE WHEN condition2 THEN expr2 ELSE 0 END) FROM table;
Schema Conditions:
None.
</Rule1>

<Rule2>
Equivalent Queries:
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM table1 INNER JOIN table2 ON table1.col1 = table2.col2 WHERE condition;
SELECT COUNT(table1.col1) FROM table2 INNER JOIN table1 ON table2.col2 = table1.col1 WHERE condition;
Schema Conditions:
table1.col1 is a non-nullable column that uniquely identifies rows in table1.
</Rule2>

<Rule3>
Equivalent Queries:
SELECT CAST(SUM(IIF(condition, 1, 0)) AS FLOAT) / SUM(IIF(condition, 1, 0)) FROM table;
SELECT CAST(SUM(CASE WHEN condition THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS REAL) / SUM(CASE WHEN condition THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) FROM table;
Schema Conditions:
None.
</Rule3>

<Rule4>
Equivalent Queries:
SELECT T2.col2 FROM table1 AS T1 INNER JOIN table2 AS T2 ON T1.col1 = T2.col1 WHERE T1.col3 = 'value1' AND T1.col4 = 'value2';
SELECT table2.col2 FROM table2 INNER JOIN table1 ON table2.col1 = table1.col1 WHERE table1.col3 = 'value1' AND table1.col4 = 'value2';
Schema Conditions:
table1.col1 is a foreign key referencing table2.col1, and table2.col1 is a primary key.
</Rule4>



# Guidelines:
- Make SURE complete to every step PERFECTLY without ANY Mistakes
- Follow the Rules I Gave you and Remember to AVOID generating repeated equivalence rules in the examples I gave you.
- Be sure to format your response like the example equivalence rules I gave you.
- Put <New Rule></New Rule> around the new equivalence rule that you think of. Do not use other formatting around the equivalent queries.
- Use GENERALIZED COLUMN AND TABLE NAMES in any EQUIVALENCE RULE YOU WRITE. DO NOT USE THE SAME NAMES IN THE PROVIDED QUERY PAIRS!!!!
- If the two queries are not logically equivalent, say <New Rule> Not equivalent </New Rule>.
- If the new equivalence rule is already repeated in the examples listed, say <New Rule> Rule exists </New Rule>.
- The new rule should be be minimal to CLEARLY demonstrate the highlighted semantic difference. Use ellipses to shorten SQL queries where necessary to achieve this.

Take a Deep Breath and Carefully Follow the Rules, Guides and Examples I gave you. I will tip you $2000 if you do EVERYTHING Perfectly.

- Make SURE complete to every step PERFECTLY without ANY Mistakes
- Follow the Rules I Gave you and Remember to AVOID generating repeated equivalence rules in the examples I gave you.
- Be sure to format your response like the example equivalence rules I gave you.
- Put <New Rule></New Rule> around the new equivalence rule that you think of. Do not use other formatting around the equivalent queries.
- Use GENERALIZED COLUMN AND TABLE NAMES in any EQUIVALENCE RULE YOU WRITE. DO NOT USE THE SAME NAMES IN THE PROVIDED QUERY PAIRS!!!!
- If the two queries are not logically equivalent, say <New Rule> Not equivalent </New Rule>.
- If the new equivalence rule is already repeated in the examples listed, say <New Rule> Rule exists </New Rule>.
- The new rule should be be MINIMAL to CLEARLY demonstrate the highlighted semantic difference. Use ellipses to shorten SQL queries where necessary to achieve this.

INFO:root:model: gpt-4o
INFO:root:prompt: You are an expert SQL engineer with 20+ years of experience. You will be given some SQL equivalence rules conditional on some database schemas. You will then be given a pair of SQL queries, consisting of a gold query and a machine-generated query, and a database schema that defines the context of the queries. 

Your task is to compare the two provided SQL queries on logical equivalence and generate one more equivalence rule in the same format as the provided example equivalence rules.

Please make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please also keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.



Evaluation Criteria:

Logical equivalence - the alignment between the gold SQL query and the machine-generated SQL query. A machine-generated SQL query is logically equivalent to the gold query if these two queries would RETURN THE SAME RESULTS AND IN THE SAME ORDER for ALL POSSIBLE DATABASE INSTANCES that satisfy the provided database schema for these queries. Annotators were asked to penalize machine-generated queries that overlooked edge cases that the gold queries would have caught otherwise.



Evaluation steps:

1. Understand the Database Schema: Identify all tables used in both queries. List all columns referenced, along with their data types and constraints. Determine primary and foreign key relationships. Note any indexes or unique constraints that may affect query execution.
2. Parse and Break Down Each Query: Identify selected columns, functions, and expressions. Note the tables involved and the join conditions. Understand the filtering conditions applied. Identify grouping and aggregate conditions, if any. Determine if result ordering affects equivalence.
3. Compare Query Components: Check if both queries use the same tables and join conditions. Compare filtering conditions in the WHERE clauses. Assess whether the same columns and expressions are selected. Identify if different functions or syntaxes achieve the same result. Look for logical equivalence in expressions and calculations.
4. Consider Edge Cases and Data Variations: Conceptualize sample datasets that include edge cases (e.g., NULL values, zero values, special characters). Analyze how each query handles these edge cases. Ensure that data type differences do not affect the outcome. Verify that constraints (e.g., NOT NULL, UNIQUE) are accounted for.
5. Evaluate Aggregations and Calculations: Confirm that aggregate functions (e.g., SUM, COUNT) are applied identically. Ensure calculations (e.g., subtraction, addition) produce the same results.
6. Check for Logical Equivalence in Conditional Expressions: Compare conditional expressions like IIF, CASE WHEN, and IF. Determine if conditions and returned values are logically the same.
7. Assess Ordering of Results: If ORDER BY clause is present, confirm that both queries order results identically. Recognize that differing order may affect equivalence if result order is significant.
8. Generate a New Logical Equivalence Rule (If Applicable): Create an "Equivalent Queries: <query1>
<query2>
Schema Conditions:<conditions>" statement that defines the equivalence. Use GENERALIZED COLUMN and TABLE NAMES. Specify any necessary conditions based on the database schema. Present the rule clearly, indicating both the equivalence and the conditions under which it holds.



Example Equivalence Rules:

<Rule1>
Equivalent Queries:
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM table1 INNER JOIN table2 ON table1.col1 = table2.col2 WHERE condition;
SELECT COUNT(table1.col1) FROM table2 INNER JOIN table1 ON table2.col2 = table1.col1 WHERE condition;
Schema Conditions:
table1.col1 is a non-nullable column that uniquely identifies rows in table1.
</Rule1>

<Rule2>
Equivalent Queries:
SELECT CAST(SUM(IIF(condition, 1, 0)) AS FLOAT) / SUM(IIF(condition, 1, 0)) FROM table;
SELECT CAST(SUM(CASE WHEN condition THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS REAL) / SUM(CASE WHEN condition THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) FROM table;
Schema Conditions:
None.
</Rule2>

<Rule3>
Equivalent Queries:
SELECT SUM(IIF(condition1, expr1, 0)) - SUM(IIF(condition2, expr2, 0)) FROM table;
SELECT SUM(CASE WHEN condition1 THEN expr1 ELSE 0 END) - SUM(CASE WHEN condition2 THEN expr2 ELSE 0 END) FROM table;
Schema Conditions:
None.
</Rule3>

<Rule4>
Equivalent Queries:
SELECT CAST(SUM(IIF(condition, 1, 0)) AS FLOAT) * 100 / COUNT(column) FROM table1 INNER JOIN table2 ON table1.col1 = table2.col1 WHERE table1.date_col = 'date_value';
SELECT CAST(SUM(CASE WHEN condition THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS REAL) * 100 / COUNT(column) FROM table2 INNER JOIN table1 ON table2.col1 = table1.col1 WHERE table1.date_col = 'date_value';
Schema Conditions:
table1.col1 is a foreign key referencing table2.col1, and table2.col1 is a primary key.
</Rule4>

<Rule5>
Equivalent Queries:
SELECT T2.col2 FROM table1 AS T1 INNER JOIN table2 AS T2 ON T1.col1 = T2.col1 WHERE T1.col3 = 'value1' AND T1.col4 = 'value2';
SELECT table2.col2 FROM table2 INNER JOIN table1 ON table2.col1 = table1.col1 WHERE table1.col3 = 'value1' AND table1.col4 = 'value2';
Schema Conditions:
table1.col1 is a foreign key referencing table2.col1, and table2.col1 is a primary key.

Therefore, they are logically equivalent.\n\n### Step 8: Generate a New Logical Equivalence Rule\n\n<New Rule>\nEquivalent Queries:\nSELECT COUNT(table1.col1) FROM table1 INNER JOIN table2 ON table1.col1 = table2.col2 INNER JOIN table3 ON table2.col3 = table3.col4 WHERE table1.condition1 = 'value' AND table3.condition2 = 'value';\nSELECT COUNT(table3.col4) FROM table3 INNER JOIN table2 ON table3.col4 = table2.col3 INNER JOIN table1 ON table2.col2 = table1.col1 WHERE table1.condition1 = 'value' AND table3.condition2 = 'value';\nSchema Conditions:\ntable1.col1 is a primary key, table3.col4 is a primary key, and table2.col2 and table2.col3 are foreign keys referencing table1.col1 and table3.col4 respectively.\n", role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None, refusal=None))], created=1730775265, model='gpt-4o-2024-08-06', object='chat.completion', system_fingerprint='fp_45cf54deae', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=854, prompt_tokens=2034, total_tokens=2888, prompt_tokens_details={'cached_tokens': 0}, completion_tokens_details={'reasoning_tokens': 0, 'accepted_prediction_tokens': 0, 'rejected_prediction_tokens': 0}))

INFO:root:prompt: You are an expert SQL engineer with 20+ years of experience. You will be given some SQL equivalence rules conditional on some database schemas. You will then be given a pair of SQL queries, consisting of a gold query and a machine-generated query, and a database schema that defines the context of the queries. 

Your task is to compare the two provided SQL queries on logical equivalence and generate one more equivalence rule in the same format as the provided example equivalence rules.

Please make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please also keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.



Evaluation Criteria:

Logical equivalence - the alignment between the gold SQL query and the machine-generated SQL query. A machine-generated SQL query is logically equivalent to the gold query if these two queries would RETURN THE SAME RESULTS AND IN THE SAME ORDER for ALL POSSIBLE DATABASE INSTANCES that satisfy the provided database schema for these queries. Annotators were asked to penalize machine-generated queries that overlooked edge cases that the gold queries would have caught otherwise.



Evaluation steps:

1. Understand the Database Schema: Identify all tables used in both queries. List all columns referenced, along with their data types and constraints. Determine primary and foreign key relationships. Note any indexes or unique constraints that may affect query execution.
2. Parse and Break Down Each Query: Identify selected columns, functions, and expressions. Note the tables involved and the join conditions. Understand the filtering conditions applied. Identify grouping and aggregate conditions, if any. Determine if result ordering affects equivalence.
3. Compare Query Components: Check if both queries use the same tables and join conditions. Compare filtering conditions in the WHERE clauses. Assess whether the same columns and expressions are selected. Identify if different functions or syntaxes achieve the same result. Look for logical equivalence in expressions and calculations.
4. Consider Edge Cases and Data Variations: Conceptualize sample datasets that include edge cases (e.g., NULL values, zero values, special characters). Analyze how each query handles these edge cases. Ensure that data type differences do not affect the outcome. Verify that constraints (e.g., NOT NULL, UNIQUE) are accounted for.
5. Evaluate Aggregations and Calculations: Confirm that aggregate functions (e.g., SUM, COUNT) are applied identically. Ensure calculations (e.g., subtraction, addition) produce the same results.
6. Check for Logical Equivalence in Conditional Expressions: Compare conditional expressions like IIF, CASE WHEN, and IF. Determine if conditions and returned values are logically the same.
7. Assess Ordering of Results: If ORDER BY clause is present, confirm that both queries order results identically. Recognize that differing order may affect equivalence if result order is significant.
8. Generate a New Logical Equivalence Rule (If Applicable): Create an "Equivalent Queries: <query1>
<query2>
Schema Conditions:<conditions>" statement that defines the equivalence. Use GENERALIZED COLUMN and TABLE NAMES. Specify any necessary conditions based on the database schema. Present the rule clearly, indicating both the equivalence and the conditions under which it holds.



Example Equivalence Rules:

<Rule1>
Equivalent Queries:
SELECT T2.col2 FROM table1 AS T1 INNER JOIN table2 AS T2 ON T1.col1 = T2.col1 WHERE T1.col3 = 'value1' AND T1.col4 = 'value2';
SELECT table2.col2 FROM table2 INNER JOIN table1 ON table2.col1 = table1.col1 WHERE table1.col3 = 'value1' AND table1.col4 = 'value2';
Schema Conditions:
table1.col1 is a foreign key referencing table2.col1, and table2.col1 is a primary key.
</Rule1>

<Rule2>
Equivalent Queries:
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM table1 INNER JOIN table2 ON table1.col1 = table2.col2 WHERE condition;
SELECT COUNT(table1.col1) FROM table2 INNER JOIN table1 ON table2.col2 = table1.col1 WHERE condition;
Schema Conditions:
table1.col1 is a non-nullable column that uniquely identifies rows in table1.
</Rule2>

<Rule3>
Equivalent Queries:
SELECT CAST(SUM(IIF(condition, 1, 0)) AS FLOAT) * 100 / COUNT(column) FROM table1 INNER JOIN table2 ON table1.col1 = table2.col1 WHERE table1.date_col = 'date_value';
SELECT CAST(SUM(CASE WHEN condition THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS REAL) * 100 / COUNT(column) FROM table2 INNER JOIN table1 ON table2.col1 = table1.col1 WHERE table1.date_col = 'date_value';
Schema Conditions:
table1.col1 is a foreign key referencing table2.col1, and table2.col1 is a primary key.
</Rule3>

<Rule4>
Equivalent Queries:
SELECT SUM(IIF(condition1, expr1, 0)) - SUM(IIF(condition2, expr2, 0)) FROM table;
SELECT SUM(CASE WHEN condition1 THEN expr1 ELSE 0 END) - SUM(CASE WHEN condition2 THEN expr2 ELSE 0 END) FROM table;
Schema Conditions:
None.
</Rule4>

<Rule5>
Equivalent Queries:
SELECT COUNT(table1.col1) FROM table1 INNER JOIN table2 ON table1.col1 = table2.col2 INNER JOIN table3 ON table2.col3 = table3.col4 WHERE table1.condition1 = 'value' AND table3.condition2 = 'value';
SELECT COUNT(table3.col4) FROM table3 INNER JOIN table2 ON table3.col4 = table2.col3 INNER JOIN table1 ON table2.col2 = table1.col1 WHERE table1.condition1 = 'value' AND table3.condition2 = 'value';
Schema Conditions:
table1.col1 is a primary key, table3.col4 is a primary key, and table2.col2 and table2.col3 are foreign keys referencing table1.col1 and table3.col4 respectively.
</Rule5>

<Rule6>
Equivalent Queries:
SELECT CAST(SUM(IIF(condition, 1, 0)) AS FLOAT) / SUM(IIF(condition, 1, 0)) FROM table;
SELECT CAST(SUM(CASE WHEN condition THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS REAL) / SUM(CASE WHEN condition THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) FROM table;
Schema Conditions:
None.
</Rule6>



# Guidelines:
- Make SURE complete to every step PERFECTLY without ANY Mistakes
- Follow the Rules I Gave you and Remember to AVOID generating repeated equivalence rules in the examples I gave you.
- Be sure to format your response like the example equivalence rules I gave you.
- Put <New Rule></New Rule> around the new equivalence rule that you think of. Do not use other formatting around the equivalent queries.
- Use GENERALIZED COLUMN AND TABLE NAMES in any EQUIVALENCE RULE YOU WRITE. DO NOT USE THE SAME NAMES IN THE PROVIDED QUERY PAIRS!!!!
- If the two queries are not logically equivalent, say <New Rule> Not equivalent </New Rule>.
- If the new equivalence rule is already repeated in the examples listed, say <New Rule> Rule exists </New Rule>.
- The new rule should be be MINIMAL to CLEARLY demonstrate the highlighted semantic difference. Use ellipses to shorten SQL queries where necessary to achieve this.

Take a Deep Breath and Carefully Follow the Rules, Guides and Examples I gave you. I will tip you $2000 if you do EVERYTHING Perfectly.

Logical equivalence - the alignment between the gold SQL query and the machine-generated SQL query. A machine-generated SQL query is logically equivalent to the gold query if these two queries would RETURN THE SAME RESULTS AND IN THE SAME ORDER for ALL POSSIBLE DATABASE INSTANCES that satisfy the provided database schema for these queries. Annotators were asked to penalize machine-generated queries that overlooked edge cases that the gold queries would have caught otherwise.



Evaluation steps:

1. Understand the Database Schema: Identify all tables used in both queries. List all columns referenced, along with their data types and constraints. Determine primary and foreign key relationships. Note any indexes or unique constraints that may affect query execution.
2. Parse and Break Down Each Query: Identify selected columns, functions, and expressions. Note the tables involved and the join conditions. Understand the filtering conditions applied. Identify grouping and aggregate conditions, if any. Determine if result ordering affects equivalence.
3. Compare Query Components: Check if both queries use the same tables and join conditions. Compare filtering conditions in the WHERE clauses. Assess whether the same columns and expressions are selected. Identify if different functions or syntaxes achieve the same result. Look for logical equivalence in expressions and calculations.
4. Consider Edge Cases and Data Variations: Conceptualize sample datasets that include edge cases (e.g., NULL values, zero values, special characters). Analyze how each query handles these edge cases. Ensure that data type differences do not affect the outcome. Verify that constraints (e.g., NOT NULL, UNIQUE) are accounted for.
5. Evaluate Aggregations and Calculations: Confirm that aggregate functions (e.g., SUM, COUNT) are applied identically. Ensure calculations (e.g., subtraction, addition) produce the same results.
6. Check for Logical Equivalence in Conditional Expressions: Compare conditional expressions like IIF, CASE WHEN, and IF. Determine if conditions and returned values are logically the same.
7. Assess Ordering of Results: If ORDER BY clause is present, confirm that both queries order results identically. Recognize that differing order may affect equivalence if result order is significant.
8. Generate a New Logical Equivalence Rule (If Applicable): Create an "Equivalent Queries: <query1>
<query2>
Schema Conditions:<conditions>" statement that defines the equivalence. Use GENERALIZED COLUMN and TABLE NAMES. Specify any necessary conditions based on the database schema. Present the rule clearly, indicating both the equivalence and the conditions under which it holds.



Example Equivalence Rules:

<Rule1>
Equivalent Queries:
SELECT COUNT(table1.col1) FROM table1 INNER JOIN table2 ON table1.col1 = table2.col2 INNER JOIN table3 ON table2.col3 = table3.col4 WHERE table1.condition1 = 'value' AND table3.condition2 = 'value';
SELECT COUNT(table3.col4) FROM table3 INNER JOIN table2 ON table3.col4 = table2.col3 INNER JOIN table1 ON table2.col2 = table1.col1 WHERE table1.condition1 = 'value' AND table3.condition2 = 'value';
Schema Conditions:
table1.col1 is a primary key, table3.col4 is a primary key, and table2.col2 and table2.col3 are foreign keys referencing table1.col1 and table3.col4 respectively.
</Rule1>

<Rule2>
Equivalent Queries:
SELECT CAST(SUM(IIF(condition, 1, 0)) AS FLOAT) * 100 / COUNT(column) FROM table1 INNER JOIN table2 ON table1.col1 = table2.col1 WHERE table1.date_col = 'date_value';
SELECT CAST(SUM(CASE WHEN condition THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS REAL) * 100 / COUNT(column) FROM table2 INNER JOIN table1 ON table2.col1 = table1.col1 WHERE table1.date_col = 'date_value';
Schema Conditions:
table1.col1 is a foreign key referencing table2.col1, and table2.col1 is a primary key.
</Rule2>

<Rule3>
Equivalent Queries:
SELECT T2.col2 FROM table1 AS T1 INNER JOIN table2 AS T2 ON T1.col1 = T2.col1 WHERE T1.col3 = 'value1' AND T1.col4 = 'value2';
SELECT table2.col2 FROM table2 INNER JOIN table1 ON table2.col1 = table1.col1 WHERE table1.col3 = 'value1' AND table1.col4 = 'value2';
Schema Conditions:
table1.col1 is a foreign key referencing table2.col1, and table2.col1 is a primary key.
</Rule3>

<Rule4>
Equivalent Queries:
SELECT ... FROM table WHERE condition1 AND condition2;
SELECT ... FROM table WHERE condition2 AND condition1;
Schema Conditions:
None.
</Rule4>

<Rule5>
Equivalent Queries:
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM table1 INNER JOIN table2 ON table1.col1 = table2.col2 WHERE condition;
SELECT COUNT(table1.col1) FROM table2 INNER JOIN table1 ON table2.col2 = table1.col1 WHERE condition;
Schema Conditions:
table1.col1 is a non-nullable column that uniquely identifies rows in table1.
</Rule5>

<Rule6>
Equivalent Queries:
SELECT CAST(SUM(IIF(condition, 1, 0)) AS FLOAT) / SUM(IIF(condition, 1, 0)) FROM table;
SELECT CAST(SUM(CASE WHEN condition THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS REAL) / SUM(CASE WHEN condition THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) FROM table;
Schema Conditions:
None.
</Rule6>

<Rule7>
Equivalent Queries:
SELECT SUM(IIF(condition1, expr1, 0)) - SUM(IIF(condition2, expr2, 0)) FROM table;
SELECT SUM(CASE WHEN condition1 THEN expr1 ELSE 0 END) - SUM(CASE WHEN condition2 THEN expr2 ELSE 0 END) FROM table;
Schema Conditions:
None.
</Rule7>



# Guidelines:
- Make SURE complete to every step PERFECTLY without ANY Mistakes
- Follow the Rules I Gave you and Remember to AVOID generating repeated equivalence rules in the examples I gave you.
- Be sure to format your response like the example equivalence rules I gave you.
- Put <New Rule></New Rule> around the new equivalence rule that you think of. Do not use other formatting around the equivalent queries.
- Use GENERALIZED COLUMN AND TABLE NAMES in any EQUIVALENCE RULE YOU WRITE. DO NOT USE THE SAME NAMES IN THE PROVIDED QUERY PAIRS!!!!
- If the two queries are not logically equivalent, say <New Rule> Not equivalent </New Rule>.
- If the new equivalence rule is already repeated in the examples listed, say <New Rule> Rule exists </New Rule>.
- The new rule should be be MINIMAL to CLEARLY demonstrate the highlighted semantic difference. Use ellipses to shorten SQL queries where necessary to achieve this.

INFO:root:model: gpt-4o
INFO:root:prompt: You are an expert SQL engineer with 20+ years of experience. You will be given some SQL equivalence rules conditional on some database schemas. You will then be given a pair of SQL queries, consisting of a gold query and a machine-generated query, and a database schema that defines the context of the queries. 

Your task is to compare the two provided SQL queries on logical equivalence and generate one more equivalence rule in the same format as the provided example equivalence rules.

Please make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please also keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.



Evaluation Criteria:

Logical equivalence - the alignment between the gold SQL query and the machine-generated SQL query. A machine-generated SQL query is logically equivalent to the gold query if these two queries would RETURN THE SAME RESULTS AND IN THE SAME ORDER for ALL POSSIBLE DATABASE INSTANCES that satisfy the provided database schema for these queries. Annotators were asked to penalize machine-generated queries that overlooked edge cases that the gold queries would have caught otherwise.



Evaluation steps:

1. Understand the Database Schema: Identify all tables used in both queries. List all columns referenced, along with their data types and constraints. Determine primary and foreign key relationships. Note any indexes or unique constraints that may affect query execution.
2. Parse and Break Down Each Query: Identify selected columns, functions, and expressions. Note the tables involved and the join conditions. Understand the filtering conditions applied. Identify grouping and aggregate conditions, if any. Determine if result ordering affects equivalence.
3. Compare Query Components: Check if both queries use the same tables and join conditions. Compare filtering conditions in the WHERE clauses. Assess whether the same columns and expressions are selected. Identify if different functions or syntaxes achieve the same result. Look for logical equivalence in expressions and calculations.
4. Consider Edge Cases and Data Variations: Conceptualize sample datasets that include edge cases (e.g., NULL values, zero values, special characters). Analyze how each query handles these edge cases. Ensure that data type differences do not affect the outcome. Verify that constraints (e.g., NOT NULL, UNIQUE) are accounted for.
5. Evaluate Aggregations and Calculations: Confirm that aggregate functions (e.g., SUM, COUNT) are applied identically. Ensure calculations (e.g., subtraction, addition) produce the same results.
6. Check for Logical Equivalence in Conditional Expressions: Compare conditional expressions like IIF, CASE WHEN, and IF. Determine if conditions and returned values are logically the same.
7. Assess Ordering of Results: If ORDER BY clause is present, confirm that both queries order results identically. Recognize that differing order may affect equivalence if result order is significant.
8. Generate a New Logical Equivalence Rule (If Applicable): Create an "Equivalent Queries: <query1>
<query2>
Schema Conditions:<conditions>" statement that defines the equivalence. Use GENERALIZED COLUMN and TABLE NAMES. Specify any necessary conditions based on the database schema. Present the rule clearly, indicating both the equivalence and the conditions under which it holds.



Example Equivalence Rules:

<Rule1>
Equivalent Queries:
SELECT ... FROM table WHERE condition1 AND condition2;
SELECT ... FROM table WHERE condition2 AND condition1;
Schema Conditions:
None.
</Rule1>

<Rule2>
Equivalent Queries:
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM table1 INNER JOIN table2 ON table1.col1 = table2.col2 WHERE condition;
SELECT COUNT(table1.col1) FROM table2 INNER JOIN table1 ON table2.col2 = table1.col1 WHERE condition;
Schema Conditions:
table1.col1 is a non-nullable column that uniquely identifies rows in table1.
</Rule2>

<Rule3>
Equivalent Queries:
SELECT CAST(SUM(IIF(condition, 1, 0)) AS FLOAT) * 100 / COUNT(column) FROM table1 INNER JOIN table2 ON table1.col1 = table2.col1 WHERE table1.date_col = 'date_value';
SELECT CAST(SUM(CASE WHEN condition THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS REAL) * 100 / COUNT(column) FROM table2 INNER JOIN table1 ON table2.col1 = table1.col1 WHERE table1.date_col = 'date_value';
Schema Conditions:
table1.col1 is a foreign key referencing table2.col1, and table2.col1 is a primary key.
</Rule3>

<Rule4>
Equivalent Queries:
SELECT T2.col2 FROM table1 AS T1 INNER JOIN table2 AS T2 ON T1.col1 = T2.col1 WHERE T1.col3 = 'value1' AND T1.col4 = 'value2';
SELECT table2.col2 FROM table2 INNER JOIN table1 ON table2.col1 = table1.col1 WHERE table1.col3 = 'value1' AND table1.col4 = 'value2';
Schema Conditions:
table1.col1 is a foreign key referencing table2.col1, and table2.col1 is a primary key.
</Rule4>

<Rule5>
Equivalent Queries:
SELECT COUNT(table1.col1) FROM table1 INNER JOIN table2 ON table1.col1 = table2.col2 INNER JOIN table3 ON table2.col3 = table3.col4 WHERE table1.condition1 = 'value' AND table3.condition2 = 'value';
SELECT COUNT(table3.col4) FROM table3 INNER JOIN table2 ON table3.col4 = table2.col3 INNER JOIN table1 ON table2.col2 = table1.col1 WHERE table1.condition1 = 'value' AND table3.condition2 = 'value';
Schema Conditions:
table1.col1 is a primary key, table3.col4 is a primary key, and table2.col2 and table2.col3 are foreign keys referencing table1.col1 and table3.col4 respectively.
</Rule5>

<Rule6>
Equivalent Queries:
SELECT SUM(IIF(condition1, expr1, 0)) - SUM(IIF(condition2, expr2, 0)) FROM table;
SELECT SUM(CASE WHEN condition1 THEN expr1 ELSE 0 END) - SUM(CASE WHEN condition2 THEN expr2 ELSE 0 END) FROM table;
Schema Conditions:
None.
</Rule6>

<Rule7>
Equivalent Queries:
SELECT CAST(SUM(IIF(condition, 1, 0)) AS FLOAT) / SUM(IIF(condition, 1, 0)) FROM table;
SELECT CAST(SUM(CASE WHEN condition THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS REAL) / SUM(CASE WHEN condition THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) FROM table;
Schema Conditions:
None.
</Rule7>



# Guidelines:
- Make SURE complete to every step PERFECTLY without ANY Mistakes
- Follow the Rules I Gave you and Remember to AVOID generating repeated equivalence rules in the examples I gave you.
- Be sure to format your response like the example equivalence rules I gave you.
- Put <New Rule></New Rule> around the new equivalence rule that you think of. Do not use other formatting around the equivalent queries.
- Use GENERALIZED COLUMN AND TABLE NAMES in any EQUIVALENCE RULE YOU WRITE. DO NOT USE THE SAME NAMES IN THE PROVIDED QUERY PAIRS!!!!
- If the two queries are not logically equivalent, say <New Rule> Not equivalent </New Rule>.
- If the new equivalence rule is already repeated in the examples listed, say <New Rule> Rule exists </New Rule>.
- The new rule should be be MINIMAL to CLEARLY demonstrate the highlighted semantic difference. Use ellipses to shorten SQL queries where necessary to achieve this.

Take a Deep Breath and Carefully Follow the Rules, Guides and Examples I gave you. I will tip you $2000 if you do EVERYTHING Perfectly.

INFO:root:prompt: You are an expert SQL engineer with 20+ years of experience. You will be given some SQL equivalence rules conditional on some database schemas. You will then be given a pair of SQL queries, consisting of a gold query and a machine-generated query, and a database schema that defines the context of the queries. 

Your task is to compare the two provided SQL queries on logical equivalence and generate one more equivalence rule in the same format as the provided example equivalence rules.

Please make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please also keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.



Evaluation Criteria:

Logical equivalence - the alignment between the gold SQL query and the machine-generated SQL query. A machine-generated SQL query is logically equivalent to the gold query if these two queries would RETURN THE SAME RESULTS AND IN THE SAME ORDER for ALL POSSIBLE DATABASE INSTANCES that satisfy the provided database schema for these queries. Annotators were asked to penalize machine-generated queries that overlooked edge cases that the gold queries would have caught otherwise.



Evaluation steps:

1. Understand the Database Schema: Identify all tables used in both queries. List all columns referenced, along with their data types and constraints. Determine primary and foreign key relationships. Note any indexes or unique constraints that may affect query execution.
2. Parse and Break Down Each Query: Identify selected columns, functions, and expressions. Note the tables involved and the join conditions. Understand the filtering conditions applied. Identify grouping and aggregate conditions, if any. Determine if result ordering affects equivalence.
3. Compare Query Components: Check if both queries use the same tables and join conditions. Compare filtering conditions in the WHERE clauses. Assess whether the same columns and expressions are selected. Identify if different functions or syntaxes achieve the same result. Look for logical equivalence in expressions and calculations.
4. Consider Edge Cases and Data Variations: Conceptualize sample datasets that include edge cases (e.g., NULL values, zero values, special characters). Analyze how each query handles these edge cases. Ensure that data type differences do not affect the outcome. Verify that constraints (e.g., NOT NULL, UNIQUE) are accounted for.
5. Evaluate Aggregations and Calculations: Confirm that aggregate functions (e.g., SUM, COUNT) are applied identically. Ensure calculations (e.g., subtraction, addition) produce the same results.
6. Check for Logical Equivalence in Conditional Expressions: Compare conditional expressions like IIF, CASE WHEN, and IF. Determine if conditions and returned values are logically the same.
7. Assess Ordering of Results: If ORDER BY clause is present, confirm that both queries order results identically. Recognize that differing order may affect equivalence if result order is significant.
8. Generate a New Logical Equivalence Rule (If Applicable): Create an "Equivalent Queries: <query1>
<query2>
Schema Conditions:<conditions>" statement that defines the equivalence. Use GENERALIZED COLUMN and TABLE NAMES. Specify any necessary conditions based on the database schema. Present the rule clearly, indicating both the equivalence and the conditions under which it holds.



Example Equivalence Rules:

<Rule1>
Equivalent Queries:
SELECT ... FROM table WHERE condition1 AND condition2;
SELECT ... FROM table WHERE condition2 AND condition1;
Schema Conditions:
None.
</Rule1>

<Rule2>
Equivalent Queries:
SELECT T2.col2 FROM table1 AS T1 INNER JOIN table2 AS T2 ON T1.col1 = T2.col1 WHERE T1.col3 = 'value1' AND T1.col4 = 'value2';
SELECT table2.col2 FROM table2 INNER JOIN table1 ON table2.col1 = table1.col1 WHERE table1.col3 = 'value1' AND table1.col4 = 'value2';
Schema Conditions:
table1.col1 is a foreign key referencing table2.col1, and table2.col1 is a primary key.
</Rule2>

<Rule3>
Equivalent Queries:
SELECT COUNT(table1.col1) FROM table1 INNER JOIN table2 ON table1.col1 = table2.col2 INNER JOIN table3 ON table2.col3 = table3.col4 WHERE table1.condition1 = 'value' AND table3.condition2 = 'value';
SELECT COUNT(table3.col4) FROM table3 INNER JOIN table2 ON table3.col4 = table2.col3 INNER JOIN table1 ON table2.col2 = table1.col1 WHERE table1.condition1 = 'value' AND table3.condition2 = 'value';
Schema Conditions:
table1.col1 is a primary key, table3.col4 is a primary key, and table2.col2 and table2.col3 are foreign keys referencing table1.col1 and table3.col4 respectively.
</Rule3>

<Rule4>
Equivalent Queries:
SELECT SUM(IIF(condition1, expr1, 0)) - SUM(IIF(condition2, expr2, 0)) FROM table;
SELECT SUM(CASE WHEN condition1 THEN expr1 ELSE 0 END) - SUM(CASE WHEN condition2 THEN expr2 ELSE 0 END) FROM table;
Schema Conditions:
None.
</Rule4>

<Rule5>
Equivalent Queries:
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM table1 INNER JOIN table2 ON table1.col1 = table2.col2 WHERE condition;
SELECT COUNT(table1.col1) FROM table2 INNER JOIN table1 ON table2.col2 = table1.col1 WHERE condition;
Schema Conditions:
table1.col1 is a non-nullable column that uniquely identifies rows in table1.
</Rule5>

<Rule6>
Equivalent Queries:
SELECT CAST(SUM(IIF(condition, 1, 0)) AS FLOAT) * 100 / COUNT(column) FROM table1 INNER JOIN table2 ON table1.col1 = table2.col1 WHERE table1.date_col = 'date_value';
SELECT CAST(SUM(CASE WHEN condition THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS REAL) * 100 / COUNT(column) FROM table2 INNER JOIN table1 ON table2.col1 = table1.col1 WHERE table1.date_col = 'date_value';
Schema Conditions:
table1.col1 is a foreign key referencing table2.col1, and table2.col1 is a primary key.
</Rule6>

<Rule7>
Equivalent Queries:
SELECT CAST(SUM(IIF(condition, 1, 0)) AS FLOAT) / SUM(IIF(condition, 1, 0)) FROM table;
SELECT CAST(SUM(CASE WHEN condition THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS REAL) / SUM(CASE WHEN condition THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) FROM table;
Schema Conditions:
None.
</Rule7>



# Guidelines:
- Make SURE complete to every step PERFECTLY without ANY Mistakes
- Follow the Rules I Gave you and Remember to AVOID generating repeated equivalence rules in the examples I gave you.
- Be sure to format your response like the example equivalence rules I gave you.
- Put <New Rule></New Rule> around the new equivalence rule that you think of. Do not use other formatting around the equivalent queries.
- Use GENERALIZED COLUMN AND TABLE NAMES in any EQUIVALENCE RULE YOU WRITE. DO NOT USE THE SAME NAMES IN THE PROVIDED QUERY PAIRS!!!!
- If the two queries are not logically equivalent, say <New Rule> Not equivalent </New Rule>.
- If the new equivalence rule is already repeated in the examples listed, say <New Rule> Rule exists </New Rule>.
- The new rule should be be MINIMAL to CLEARLY demonstrate the highlighted semantic difference. Use ellipses to shorten SQL queries where necessary to achieve this.

INFO:root:model: gpt-4o
INFO:root:prompt: You are an expert SQL engineer with 20+ years of experience. You will be given some SQL equivalence rules conditional on some database schemas. You will then be given a pair of SQL queries, consisting of a gold query and a machine-generated query, and a database schema that defines the context of the queries. 

Your task is to compare the two provided SQL queries on logical equivalence and generate one more equivalence rule in the same format as the provided example equivalence rules.

Please make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please also keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.



Evaluation Criteria:

Logical equivalence - the alignment between the gold SQL query and the machine-generated SQL query. A machine-generated SQL query is logically equivalent to the gold query if these two queries would RETURN THE SAME RESULTS AND IN THE SAME ORDER for ALL POSSIBLE DATABASE INSTANCES that satisfy the provided database schema for these queries. Annotators were asked to penalize machine-generated queries that overlooked edge cases that the gold queries would have caught otherwise.



Evaluation steps:

1. Understand the Database Schema: Identify all tables used in both queries. List all columns referenced, along with their data types and constraints. Determine primary and foreign key relationships. Note any indexes or unique constraints that may affect query execution.
2. Parse and Break Down Each Query: Identify selected columns, functions, and expressions. Note the tables involved and the join conditions. Understand the filtering conditions applied. Identify grouping and aggregate conditions, if any. Determine if result ordering affects equivalence.
3. Compare Query Components: Check if both queries use the same tables and join conditions. Compare filtering conditions in the WHERE clauses. Assess whether the same columns and expressions are selected. Identify if different functions or syntaxes achieve the same result. Look for logical equivalence in expressions and calculations.
4. Consider Edge Cases and Data Variations: Conceptualize sample datasets that include edge cases (e.g., NULL values, zero values, special characters). Analyze how each query handles these edge cases. Ensure that data type differences do not affect the outcome. Verify that constraints (e.g., NOT NULL, UNIQUE) are accounted for.
5. Evaluate Aggregations and Calculations: Confirm that aggregate functions (e.g., SUM, COUNT) are applied identically. Ensure calculations (e.g., subtraction, addition) produce the same results.
6. Check for Logical Equivalence in Conditional Expressions: Compare conditional expressions like IIF, CASE WHEN, and IF. Determine if conditions and returned values are logically the same.
7. Assess Ordering of Results: If ORDER BY clause is present, confirm that both queries order results identically. Recognize that differing order may affect equivalence if result order is significant.
8. Generate a New Logical Equivalence Rule (If Applicable): Create an "Equivalent Queries: <query1>
<query2>
Schema Conditions:<conditions>" statement that defines the equivalence. Use GENERALIZED COLUMN and TABLE NAMES. Specify any necessary conditions based on the database schema. Present the rule clearly, indicating both the equivalence and the conditions under which it holds.



Example Equivalence Rules:

<Rule1>
Equivalent Queries:
SELECT SUM(IIF(condition1, expr1, 0)) - SUM(IIF(condition2, expr2, 0)) FROM table;
SELECT SUM(CASE WHEN condition1 THEN expr1 ELSE 0 END) - SUM(CASE WHEN condition2 THEN expr2 ELSE 0 END) FROM table;
Schema Conditions:
None.
</Rule1>

<Rule2>
Equivalent Queries:
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM table1 INNER JOIN table2 ON table1.col1 = table2.col2 WHERE condition;
SELECT COUNT(table1.col1) FROM table2 INNER JOIN table1 ON table2.col2 = table1.col1 WHERE condition;
Schema Conditions:
table1.col1 is a non-nullable column that uniquely identifies rows in table1.
</Rule2>

<Rule3>
Equivalent Queries:
SELECT ... FROM table WHERE condition1 AND condition2;
SELECT ... FROM table WHERE condition2 AND condition1;
Schema Conditions:
None.
</Rule3>

<Rule4>
Equivalent Queries:
SELECT T2.col2 FROM table1 AS T1 INNER JOIN table2 AS T2 ON T1.col1 = T2.col1 WHERE T1.col3 = 'value1' AND T1.col4 = 'value2';
SELECT table2.col2 FROM table2 INNER JOIN table1 ON table2.col1 = table1.col1 WHERE table1.col3 = 'value1' AND table1.col4 = 'value2';
Schema Conditions:
table1.col1 is a foreign key referencing table2.col1, and table2.col1 is a primary key.
</Rule4>

<Rule5>
Equivalent Queries:
SELECT CAST(SUM(IIF(condition, 1, 0)) AS FLOAT) * 100 / COUNT(column) FROM table1 INNER JOIN table2 ON table1.col1 = table2.col1 WHERE table1.date_col = 'date_value';
SELECT CAST(SUM(CASE WHEN condition THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS REAL) * 100 / COUNT(column) FROM table2 INNER JOIN table1 ON table2.col1 = table1.col1 WHERE table1.date_col = 'date_value';
Schema Conditions:
table1.col1 is a foreign key referencing table2.col1, and table2.col1 is a primary key.
</Rule5>

<Rule6>
Equivalent Queries:
SELECT COUNT(table1.col1) FROM table1 INNER JOIN table2 ON table1.col1 = table2.col2 INNER JOIN table3 ON table2.col3 = table3.col4 WHERE table1.condition1 = 'value' AND table3.condition2 = 'value';
SELECT COUNT(table3.col4) FROM table3 INNER JOIN table2 ON table3.col4 = table2.col3 INNER JOIN table1 ON table2.col2 = table1.col1 WHERE table1.condition1 = 'value' AND table3.condition2 = 'value';
Schema Conditions:
table1.col1 is a primary key, table3.col4 is a primary key, and table2.col2 and table2.col3 are foreign keys referencing table1.col1 and table3.col4 respectively.
</Rule6>

<Rule7>
Equivalent Queries:
SELECT CAST(SUM(IIF(condition, 1, 0)) AS FLOAT) / SUM(IIF(condition, 1, 0)) FROM table;
SELECT CAST(SUM(CASE WHEN condition THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS REAL) / SUM(CASE WHEN condition THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) FROM table;
Schema Conditions:
None.
</Rule7>



# Guidelines:
- Make SURE complete to every step PERFECTLY without ANY Mistakes
- Follow the Rules I Gave you and Remember to AVOID generating repeated equivalence rules in the examples I gave you.
- Be sure to format your response like the example equivalence rules I gave you.
- Put <New Rule></New Rule> around the new equivalence rule that you think of. Do not use other formatting around the equivalent queries.
- Use GENERALIZED COLUMN AND TABLE NAMES in any EQUIVALENCE RULE YOU WRITE. DO NOT USE THE SAME NAMES IN THE PROVIDED QUERY PAIRS!!!!
- If the two queries are not logically equivalent, say <New Rule> Not equivalent </New Rule>.
- If the new equivalence rule is already repeated in the examples listed, say <New Rule> Rule exists </New Rule>.
- The new rule should be be MINIMAL to CLEARLY demonstrate the highlighted semantic difference. Use ellipses to shorten SQL queries where necessary to achieve this.

Take a Deep Breath and Carefully Follow the Rules, Guides and Examples I gave you. I will tip you $2000 if you do EVERYTHING Perfectly.

INFO:root:prompt: You are an expert SQL engineer with 20+ years of experience. You will be given some SQL equivalence rules conditional on some database schemas. You will then be given a pair of SQL queries, consisting of a gold query and a machine-generated query, and a database schema that defines the context of the queries. 

Your task is to compare the two provided SQL queries on logical equivalence and generate one more equivalence rule in the same format as the provided example equivalence rules.

Please make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please also keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.



Evaluation Criteria:

Logical equivalence - the alignment between the gold SQL query and the machine-generated SQL query. A machine-generated SQL query is logically equivalent to the gold query if these two queries would RETURN THE SAME RESULTS AND IN THE SAME ORDER for ALL POSSIBLE DATABASE INSTANCES that satisfy the provided database schema for these queries. Annotators were asked to penalize machine-generated queries that overlooked edge cases that the gold queries would have caught otherwise.



Evaluation steps:

1. Understand the Database Schema: Identify all tables used in both queries. List all columns referenced, along with their data types and constraints. Determine primary and foreign key relationships. Note any indexes or unique constraints that may affect query execution.
2. Parse and Break Down Each Query: Identify selected columns, functions, and expressions. Note the tables involved and the join conditions. Understand the filtering conditions applied. Identify grouping and aggregate conditions, if any. Determine if result ordering affects equivalence.
3. Compare Query Components: Check if both queries use the same tables and join conditions. Compare filtering conditions in the WHERE clauses. Assess whether the same columns and expressions are selected. Identify if different functions or syntaxes achieve the same result. Look for logical equivalence in expressions and calculations.
4. Consider Edge Cases and Data Variations: Conceptualize sample datasets that include edge cases (e.g., NULL values, zero values, special characters). Analyze how each query handles these edge cases. Ensure that data type differences do not affect the outcome. Verify that constraints (e.g., NOT NULL, UNIQUE) are accounted for.
5. Evaluate Aggregations and Calculations: Confirm that aggregate functions (e.g., SUM, COUNT) are applied identically. Ensure calculations (e.g., subtraction, addition) produce the same results.
6. Check for Logical Equivalence in Conditional Expressions: Compare conditional expressions like IIF, CASE WHEN, and IF. Determine if conditions and returned values are logically the same.
7. Assess Ordering of Results: If ORDER BY clause is present, confirm that both queries order results identically. Recognize that differing order may affect equivalence if result order is significant.
8. Generate a New Logical Equivalence Rule (If Applicable): Create an "Equivalent Queries: <query1>
<query2>
Schema Conditions:<conditions>" statement that defines the equivalence. Use GENERALIZED COLUMN and TABLE NAMES. Specify any necessary conditions based on the database schema. Present the rule clearly, indicating both the equivalence and the conditions under which it holds.



Example Equivalence Rules:

<Rule1>
Equivalent Queries:
SELECT SUM(IIF(condition1, expr1, 0)) - SUM(IIF(condition2, expr2, 0)) FROM table;
SELECT SUM(CASE WHEN condition1 THEN expr1 ELSE 0 END) - SUM(CASE WHEN condition2 THEN expr2 ELSE 0 END) FROM table;
Schema Conditions:
None.
</Rule1>

<Rule2>
Equivalent Queries:
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM table1 INNER JOIN table2 ON table1.col1 = table2.col2 WHERE condition;
SELECT COUNT(table1.col1) FROM table2 INNER JOIN table1 ON table2.col2 = table1.col1 WHERE condition;
Schema Conditions:
table1.col1 is a non-nullable column that uniquely identifies rows in table1.
</Rule2>

<Rule3>
Equivalent Queries:
SELECT COUNT(table1.col1) FROM table1 INNER JOIN table2 ON table1.col1 = table2.col2 INNER JOIN table3 ON table2.col3 = table3.col4 WHERE table1.condition1 = 'value' AND table3.condition2 = 'value';
SELECT COUNT(table3.col4) FROM table3 INNER JOIN table2 ON table3.col4 = table2.col3 INNER JOIN table1 ON table2.col2 = table1.col1 WHERE table1.condition1 = 'value' AND table3.condition2 = 'value';
Schema Conditions:
table1.col1 is a primary key, table3.col4 is a primary key, and table2.col2 and table2.col3 are foreign keys referencing table1.col1 and table3.col4 respectively.
</Rule3>

<Rule4>
Equivalent Queries:
SELECT ... FROM table WHERE condition1 AND condition2;
SELECT ... FROM table WHERE condition2 AND condition1;
Schema Conditions:
None.
</Rule4>

<Rule5>
Equivalent Queries:
SELECT T2.col2 FROM table1 AS T1 INNER JOIN table2 AS T2 ON T1.col1 = T2.col1 WHERE T1.col3 = 'value1' AND T1.col4 = 'value2';
SELECT table2.col2 FROM table2 INNER JOIN table1 ON table2.col1 = table1.col1 WHERE table1.col3 = 'value1' AND table1.col4 = 'value2';
Schema Conditions:
table1.col1 is a foreign key referencing table2.col1, and table2.col1 is a primary key.
</Rule5>

<Rule6>
Equivalent Queries:
SELECT CAST(SUM(IIF(condition, 1, 0)) AS FLOAT) / SUM(IIF(condition, 1, 0)) FROM table;
SELECT CAST(SUM(CASE WHEN condition THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS REAL) / SUM(CASE WHEN condition THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) FROM table;
Schema Conditions:
None.
</Rule6>

<Rule7>
Equivalent Queries:
SELECT CAST(SUM(IIF(condition, 1, 0)) AS FLOAT) * 100 / COUNT(column) FROM table1 INNER JOIN table2 ON table1.col1 = table2.col1 WHERE table1.date_col = 'date_value';
SELECT CAST(SUM(CASE WHEN condition THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS REAL) * 100 / COUNT(column) FROM table2 INNER JOIN table1 ON table2.col1 = table1.col1 WHERE table1.date_col = 'date_value';
Schema Conditions:
table1.col1 is a foreign key referencing table2.col1, and table2.col1 is a primary key.
</Rule7>



# Guidelines:
- Make SURE complete to every step PERFECTLY without ANY Mistakes
- Follow the Rules I Gave you and Remember to AVOID generating repeated equivalence rules in the examples I gave you.
- Be sure to format your response like the example equivalence rules I gave you.
- Put <New Rule></New Rule> around the new equivalence rule that you think of. Do not use other formatting around the equivalent queries.
- Use GENERALIZED COLUMN AND TABLE NAMES in any EQUIVALENCE RULE YOU WRITE. DO NOT USE THE SAME NAMES IN THE PROVIDED QUERY PAIRS!!!!
- If the two queries are not logically equivalent, say <New Rule> Not equivalent </New Rule>.
- If the new equivalence rule is already repeated in the examples listed, say <New Rule> Rule exists </New Rule>.
- The new rule should be be MINIMAL to CLEARLY demonstrate the highlighted semantic difference. Use ellipses to shorten SQL queries where necessary to achieve this.

Take a Deep Breath and Carefully Follow the Rules, Guides and Examples I gave you. I will tip you $2000 if you do EVERYTHING Perfectly.

INFO:root:model: gpt-4o
INFO:root:prompt: You are an expert SQL engineer with 20+ years of experience. You will be given some SQL equivalence rules conditional on some database schemas. You will then be given a pair of SQL queries, consisting of a gold query and a machine-generated query, and a database schema that defines the context of the queries. 

Your task is to compare the two provided SQL queries on logical equivalence and generate one more equivalence rule in the same format as the provided example equivalence rules.

Please make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please also keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.



Evaluation Criteria:

Logical equivalence - the alignment between the gold SQL query and the machine-generated SQL query. A machine-generated SQL query is logically equivalent to the gold query if these two queries would RETURN THE SAME RESULTS AND IN THE SAME ORDER for ALL POSSIBLE DATABASE INSTANCES that satisfy the provided database schema for these queries. Annotators were asked to penalize machine-generated queries that overlooked edge cases that the gold queries would have caught otherwise.



Evaluation steps:

1. Understand the Database Schema: Identify all tables used in both queries. List all columns referenced, along with their data types and constraints. Determine primary and foreign key relationships. Note any indexes or unique constraints that may affect query execution.
2. Parse and Break Down Each Query: Identify selected columns, functions, and expressions. Note the tables involved and the join conditions. Understand the filtering conditions applied. Identify grouping and aggregate conditions, if any. Determine if result ordering affects equivalence.
3. Compare Query Components: Check if both queries use the same tables and join conditions. Compare filtering conditions in the WHERE clauses. Assess whether the same columns and expressions are selected. Identify if different functions or syntaxes achieve the same result. Look for logical equivalence in expressions and calculations.
4. Consider Edge Cases and Data Variations: Conceptualize sample datasets that include edge cases (e.g., NULL values, zero values, special characters). Analyze how each query handles these edge cases. Ensure that data type differences do not affect the outcome. Verify that constraints (e.g., NOT NULL, UNIQUE) are accounted for.
5. Evaluate Aggregations and Calculations: Confirm that aggregate functions (e.g., SUM, COUNT) are applied identically. Ensure calculations (e.g., subtraction, addition) produce the same results.
6. Check for Logical Equivalence in Conditional Expressions: Compare conditional expressions like IIF, CASE WHEN, and IF. Determine if conditions and returned values are logically the same.
7. Assess Ordering of Results: If ORDER BY clause is present, confirm that both queries order results identically. Recognize that differing order may affect equivalence if result order is significant.
8. Generate a New Logical Equivalence Rule (If Applicable): Create an "Equivalent Queries: <query1>
<query2>
Schema Conditions:<conditions>" statement that defines the equivalence. Use GENERALIZED COLUMN and TABLE NAMES. Specify any necessary conditions based on the database schema. Present the rule clearly, indicating both the equivalence and the conditions under which it holds.



Example Equivalence Rules:

<Rule1>
Equivalent Queries:
SELECT CAST(SUM(IIF(condition, 1, 0)) AS FLOAT) * 100 / COUNT(column) FROM table1 INNER JOIN table2 ON table1.col1 = table2.col1 WHERE table1.date_col = 'date_value';
SELECT CAST(SUM(CASE WHEN condition THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS REAL) * 100 / COUNT(column) FROM table2 INNER JOIN table1 ON table2.col1 = table1.col1 WHERE table1.date_col = 'date_value';
Schema Conditions:
table1.col1 is a foreign key referencing table2.col1, and table2.col1 is a primary key.
</Rule1>

<Rule2>
Equivalent Queries:
SELECT CAST(SUM(IIF(condition, 1, 0)) AS FLOAT) / SUM(IIF(condition, 1, 0)) FROM table;
SELECT CAST(SUM(CASE WHEN condition THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS REAL) / SUM(CASE WHEN condition THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) FROM table;
Schema Conditions:
None.
</Rule2>

<Rule3>
Equivalent Queries:
SELECT T2.col2 FROM table1 AS T1 INNER JOIN table2 AS T2 ON T1.col1 = T2.col1 WHERE T1.col3 = 'value1' AND T1.col4 = 'value2';
SELECT table2.col2 FROM table2 INNER JOIN table1 ON table2.col1 = table1.col1 WHERE table1.col3 = 'value1' AND table1.col4 = 'value2';
Schema Conditions:
table1.col1 is a foreign key referencing table2.col1, and table2.col1 is a primary key.
</Rule3>

<Rule4>
Equivalent Queries:
SELECT COUNT(table1.col1) FROM table1 INNER JOIN table2 ON table1.col1 = table2.col2 INNER JOIN table3 ON table2.col3 = table3.col4 WHERE table1.condition1 = 'value' AND table3.condition2 = 'value';
SELECT COUNT(table3.col4) FROM table3 INNER JOIN table2 ON table3.col4 = table2.col3 INNER JOIN table1 ON table2.col2 = table1.col1 WHERE table1.condition1 = 'value' AND table3.condition2 = 'value';
Schema Conditions:
table1.col1 is a primary key, table3.col4 is a primary key, and table2.col2 and table2.col3 are foreign keys referencing table1.col1 and table3.col4 respectively.
</Rule4>

<Rule5>
Equivalent Queries:
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM table1 INNER JOIN table2 ON table1.col1 = table2.col2 WHERE condition;
SELECT COUNT(table1.col1) FROM table2 INNER JOIN table1 ON table2.col2 = table1.col1 WHERE condition;
Schema Conditions:
table1.col1 is a non-nullable column that uniquely identifies rows in table1.
</Rule5>

<Rule6>
Equivalent Queries:
SELECT SUM(IIF(condition1, expr1, 0)) - SUM(IIF(condition2, expr2, 0)) FROM table;
SELECT SUM(CASE WHEN condition1 THEN expr1 ELSE 0 END) - SUM(CASE WHEN condition2 THEN expr2 ELSE 0 END) FROM table;
Schema Conditions:
None.
</Rule6>

<Rule7>
Equivalent Queries:
SELECT ... FROM table WHERE condition1 AND condition2;
SELECT ... FROM table WHERE condition2 AND condition1;
Schema Conditions:
None.
</Rule7>



# Guidelines:
- Make SURE complete to every step PERFECTLY without ANY Mistakes
- Follow the Rules I Gave you and Remember to AVOID generating repeated equivalence rules in the examples I gave you.
- Be sure to format your response like the example equivalence rules I gave you.
- Put <New Rule></New Rule> around the new equivalence rule that you think of. Do not use other formatting around the equivalent queries.
- Use GENERALIZED COLUMN AND TABLE NAMES in any EQUIVALENCE RULE YOU WRITE. DO NOT USE THE SAME NAMES IN THE PROVIDED QUERY PAIRS!!!!
- If the two queries are not logically equivalent, say <New Rule> Not equivalent </New Rule>.
- If the new equivalence rule is already repeated in the examples listed, say <New Rule> Rule exists </New Rule>.
- The new rule should be be MINIMAL to CLEARLY demonstrate the highlighted semantic difference. Use ellipses to shorten SQL queries where necessary to achieve this.

Take a Deep Breath and Carefully Follow the Rules, Guides and Examples I gave you. I will tip you $2000 if you do EVERYTHING Perfectly.

INFO:root:prompt: You are an expert SQL engineer with 20+ years of experience. You will be given some SQL equivalence rules conditional on some database schemas. You will then be given a pair of SQL queries, consisting of a gold query and a machine-generated query, and a database schema that defines the context of the queries. 

Your task is to compare the two provided SQL queries on logical equivalence and generate one more equivalence rule in the same format as the provided example equivalence rules.

Please make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please also keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.



Evaluation Criteria:

Logical equivalence - the alignment between the gold SQL query and the machine-generated SQL query. A machine-generated SQL query is logically equivalent to the gold query if these two queries would RETURN THE SAME RESULTS AND IN THE SAME ORDER for ALL POSSIBLE DATABASE INSTANCES that satisfy the provided database schema for these queries. Annotators were asked to penalize machine-generated queries that overlooked edge cases that the gold queries would have caught otherwise.



Evaluation steps:

1. Understand the Database Schema: Identify all tables used in both queries. List all columns referenced, along with their data types and constraints. Determine primary and foreign key relationships. Note any indexes or unique constraints that may affect query execution.
2. Parse and Break Down Each Query: Identify selected columns, functions, and expressions. Note the tables involved and the join conditions. Understand the filtering conditions applied. Identify grouping and aggregate conditions, if any. Determine if result ordering affects equivalence.
3. Compare Query Components: Check if both queries use the same tables and join conditions. Compare filtering conditions in the WHERE clauses. Assess whether the same columns and expressions are selected. Identify if different functions or syntaxes achieve the same result. Look for logical equivalence in expressions and calculations.
4. Consider Edge Cases and Data Variations: Conceptualize sample datasets that include edge cases (e.g., NULL values, zero values, special characters). Analyze how each query handles these edge cases. Ensure that data type differences do not affect the outcome. Verify that constraints (e.g., NOT NULL, UNIQUE) are accounted for.
5. Evaluate Aggregations and Calculations: Confirm that aggregate functions (e.g., SUM, COUNT) are applied identically. Ensure calculations (e.g., subtraction, addition) produce the same results.
6. Check for Logical Equivalence in Conditional Expressions: Compare conditional expressions like IIF, CASE WHEN, and IF. Determine if conditions and returned values are logically the same.
7. Assess Ordering of Results: If ORDER BY clause is present, confirm that both queries order results identically. Recognize that differing order may affect equivalence if result order is significant.
8. Generate a New Logical Equivalence Rule (If Applicable): Create an "Equivalent Queries: <query1>
<query2>
Schema Conditions:<conditions>" statement that defines the equivalence. Use GENERALIZED COLUMN and TABLE NAMES. Specify any necessary conditions based on the database schema. Present the rule clearly, indicating both the equivalence and the conditions under which it holds.



Example Equivalence Rules:

<Rule1>
Equivalent Queries:
SELECT T2.col2 FROM table1 AS T1 INNER JOIN table2 AS T2 ON T1.col1 = T2.col1 WHERE T1.col3 = 'value1' AND T1.col4 = 'value2';
SELECT table2.col2 FROM table2 INNER JOIN table1 ON table2.col1 = table1.col1 WHERE table1.col3 = 'value1' AND table1.col4 = 'value2';
Schema Conditions:
table1.col1 is a foreign key referencing table2.col1, and table2.col1 is a primary key.
</Rule1>

<Rule2>
Equivalent Queries:
SELECT CAST(SUM(IIF(condition, 1, 0)) AS FLOAT) * 100 / COUNT(column) FROM table1 INNER JOIN table2 ON table1.col1 = table2.col1 WHERE table1.date_col = 'date_value';
SELECT CAST(SUM(CASE WHEN condition THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS REAL) * 100 / COUNT(column) FROM table2 INNER JOIN table1 ON table2.col1 = table1.col1 WHERE table1.date_col = 'date_value';
Schema Conditions:
table1.col1 is a foreign key referencing table2.col1, and table2.col1 is a primary key.
</Rule2>

<Rule3>
Equivalent Queries:
SELECT ... FROM table WHERE condition1 AND condition2;
SELECT ... FROM table WHERE condition2 AND condition1;
Schema Conditions:
None.
</Rule3>

<Rule4>
Equivalent Queries:
SELECT SUM(IIF(condition1, expr1, 0)) - SUM(IIF(condition2, expr2, 0)) FROM table;
SELECT SUM(CASE WHEN condition1 THEN expr1 ELSE 0 END) - SUM(CASE WHEN condition2 THEN expr2 ELSE 0 END) FROM table;
Schema Conditions:
None.
</Rule4>

<Rule5>
Equivalent Queries:
SELECT COUNT(table1.col1) FROM table1 INNER JOIN table2 ON table1.col1 = table2.col2 INNER JOIN table3 ON table2.col3 = table3.col4 WHERE table1.condition1 = 'value' AND table3.condition2 = 'value';
SELECT COUNT(table3.col4) FROM table3 INNER JOIN table2 ON table3.col4 = table2.col3 INNER JOIN table1 ON table2.col2 = table1.col1 WHERE table1.condition1 = 'value' AND table3.condition2 = 'value';
Schema Conditions:
table1.col1 is a primary key, table3.col4 is a primary key, and table2.col2 and table2.col3 are foreign keys referencing table1.col1 and table3.col4 respectively.
</Rule5>

<Rule6>
Equivalent Queries:
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM table1 INNER JOIN table2 ON table1.col1 = table2.col2 WHERE condition;
SELECT COUNT(table1.col1) FROM table2 INNER JOIN table1 ON table2.col2 = table1.col1 WHERE condition;
Schema Conditions:
table1.col1 is a non-nullable column that uniquely identifies rows in table1.
</Rule6>

<Rule7>
Equivalent Queries:
SELECT CAST(SUM(IIF(condition, 1, 0)) AS FLOAT) / SUM(IIF(condition, 1, 0)) FROM table;
SELECT CAST(SUM(CASE WHEN condition THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS REAL) / SUM(CASE WHEN condition THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) FROM table;
Schema Conditions:
None.
</Rule7>



# Guidelines:
- Make SURE complete to every step PERFECTLY without ANY Mistakes
- Follow the Rules I Gave you and Remember to AVOID generating repeated equivalence rules in the examples I gave you.
- Be sure to format your response like the example equivalence rules I gave you.
- Put <New Rule></New Rule> around the new equivalence rule that you think of. Do not use other formatting around the equivalent queries.
- Use GENERALIZED COLUMN AND TABLE NAMES in any EQUIVALENCE RULE YOU WRITE. DO NOT USE THE SAME NAMES IN THE PROVIDED QUERY PAIRS!!!!
- If the two queries are not logically equivalent, say <New Rule> Not equivalent </New Rule>.
- If the new equivalence rule is already repeated in the examples listed, say <New Rule> Rule exists </New Rule>.
- The new rule should be be MINIMAL to CLEARLY demonstrate the highlighted semantic difference. Use ellipses to shorten SQL queries where necessary to achieve this.

Take a Deep Breath and Carefully Follow the Rules, Guides and Examples I gave you. I will tip you $2000 if you do EVERYTHING Perfectly.

# Guidelines:
- Make SURE complete to every step PERFECTLY without ANY Mistakes
- Follow the Rules I Gave you and Remember to AVOID generating repeated equivalence rules in the examples I gave you.
- Be sure to format your response like the example equivalence rules I gave you.
- Put <New Rule></New Rule> around the new equivalence rule that you think of. Do not use other formatting around the equivalent queries.
- Use GENERALIZED COLUMN AND TABLE NAMES in any EQUIVALENCE RULE YOU WRITE. DO NOT USE THE SAME NAMES IN THE PROVIDED QUERY PAIRS!!!!
- If the two queries are not logically equivalent, say <New Rule> Not equivalent </New Rule>.
- If the new equivalence rule is already repeated in the examples listed, say <New Rule> Rule exists </New Rule>.
- The new rule should be be MINIMAL to CLEARLY demonstrate the highlighted semantic difference. Use ellipses to shorten SQL queries where necessary to achieve this.

INFO:root:model: gpt-4o
INFO:root:prompt: You are an expert SQL engineer with 20+ years of experience. You will be given some SQL equivalence rules conditional on some database schemas. You will then be given a pair of SQL queries, consisting of a gold query and a machine-generated query, and a database schema that defines the context of the queries. 

Your task is to compare the two provided SQL queries on logical equivalence and generate one more equivalence rule in the same format as the provided example equivalence rules.

Please make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please also keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.



Evaluation Criteria:

Logical equivalence - the alignment between the gold SQL query and the machine-generated SQL query. A machine-generated SQL query is logically equivalent to the gold query if these two queries would RETURN THE SAME RESULTS AND IN THE SAME ORDER for ALL POSSIBLE DATABASE INSTANCES that satisfy the provided database schema for these queries. Annotators were asked to penalize machine-generated queries that overlooked edge cases that the gold queries would have caught otherwise.



Evaluation steps:

1. Understand the Database Schema: Identify all tables used in both queries. List all columns referenced, along with their data types and constraints. Determine primary and foreign key relationships. Note any indexes or unique constraints that may affect query execution.
2. Parse and Break Down Each Query: Identify selected columns, functions, and expressions. Note the tables involved and the join conditions. Understand the filtering conditions applied. Identify grouping and aggregate conditions, if any. Determine if result ordering affects equivalence.
3. Compare Query Components: Check if both queries use the same tables and join conditions. Compare filtering conditions in the WHERE clauses. Assess whether the same columns and expressions are selected. Identify if different functions or syntaxes achieve the same result. Look for logical equivalence in expressions and calculations.
4. Consider Edge Cases and Data Variations: Conceptualize sample datasets that include edge cases (e.g., NULL values, zero values, special characters). Analyze how each query handles these edge cases. Ensure that data type differences do not affect the outcome. Verify that constraints (e.g., NOT NULL, UNIQUE) are accounted for.
5. Evaluate Aggregations and Calculations: Confirm that aggregate functions (e.g., SUM, COUNT) are applied identically. Ensure calculations (e.g., subtraction, addition) produce the same results.
6. Check for Logical Equivalence in Conditional Expressions: Compare conditional expressions like IIF, CASE WHEN, and IF. Determine if conditions and returned values are logically the same.
7. Assess Ordering of Results: If ORDER BY clause is present, confirm that both queries order results identically. Recognize that differing order may affect equivalence if result order is significant.
8. Generate a New Logical Equivalence Rule (If Applicable): Create an "Equivalent Queries: <query1>
<query2>
Schema Conditions:<conditions>" statement that defines the equivalence. Use GENERALIZED COLUMN and TABLE NAMES. Specify any necessary conditions based on the database schema. Present the rule clearly, indicating both the equivalence and the conditions under which it holds.



Example Equivalence Rules:

<Rule1>
Equivalent Queries:
SELECT CAST(SUM(IIF(condition, 1, 0)) AS FLOAT) * 100 / COUNT(column) FROM table1 INNER JOIN table2 ON table1.col1 = table2.col1 WHERE table1.date_col = 'date_value';
SELECT CAST(SUM(CASE WHEN condition THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS REAL) * 100 / COUNT(column) FROM table2 INNER JOIN table1 ON table2.col1 = table1.col1 WHERE table1.date_col = 'date_value';
Schema Conditions:
table1.col1 is a foreign key referencing table2.col1, and table2.col1 is a primary key.
</Rule1>

<Rule2>
Equivalent Queries:
SELECT CAST(SUM(IIF(condition, 1, 0)) AS FLOAT) / SUM(IIF(condition, 1, 0)) FROM table;
SELECT CAST(SUM(CASE WHEN condition THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS REAL) / SUM(CASE WHEN condition THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) FROM table;
Schema Conditions:
None.
</Rule2>

<Rule3>
Equivalent Queries:
SELECT SUM(IIF(condition1, expr1, 0)) - SUM(IIF(condition2, expr2, 0)) FROM table;
SELECT SUM(CASE WHEN condition1 THEN expr1 ELSE 0 END) - SUM(CASE WHEN condition2 THEN expr2 ELSE 0 END) FROM table;
Schema Conditions:
None.
</Rule3>

<Rule4>
Equivalent Queries:
SELECT T2.col2 FROM table1 AS T1 INNER JOIN table2 AS T2 ON T1.col1 = T2.col1 WHERE T1.col3 = 'value1' AND T1.col4 = 'value2';
SELECT table2.col2 FROM table2 INNER JOIN table1 ON table2.col1 = table1.col1 WHERE table1.col3 = 'value1' AND table1.col4 = 'value2';
Schema Conditions:
table1.col1 is a foreign key referencing table2.col1, and table2.col1 is a primary key.
</Rule4>

<Rule5>
Equivalent Queries:
SELECT ... FROM table WHERE condition1 AND condition2;
SELECT ... FROM table WHERE condition2 AND condition1;
Schema Conditions:
None.
</Rule5>

<Rule6>
Equivalent Queries:
SELECT COUNT(table1.col1) FROM table1 INNER JOIN table2 ON table1.col1 = table2.col2 INNER JOIN table3 ON table2.col3 = table3.col4 WHERE table1.condition1 = 'value' AND table3.condition2 = 'value';
SELECT COUNT(table3.col4) FROM table3 INNER JOIN table2 ON table3.col4 = table2.col3 INNER JOIN table1 ON table2.col2 = table1.col1 WHERE table1.condition1 = 'value' AND table3.condition2 = 'value';
Schema Conditions:
table1.col1 is a primary key, table3.col4 is a primary key, and table2.col2 and table2.col3 are foreign keys referencing table1.col1 and table3.col4 respectively.
</Rule6>

<Rule7>
Equivalent Queries:
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM table1 INNER JOIN table2 ON table1.col1 = table2.col2 WHERE condition;
SELECT COUNT(table1.col1) FROM table2 INNER JOIN table1 ON table2.col2 = table1.col1 WHERE condition;
Schema Conditions:
table1.col1 is a non-nullable column that uniquely identifies rows in table1.
</Rule7>

INFO:root:prompt: You are an expert SQL engineer with 20+ years of experience. You will be given some SQL equivalence rules conditional on some database schemas. You will then be given a pair of SQL queries, consisting of a gold query and a machine-generated query, and a database schema that defines the context of the queries. 

Your task is to compare the two provided SQL queries on logical equivalence and generate one more equivalence rule in the same format as the provided example equivalence rules.

Please make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please also keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.



Evaluation Criteria:

Logical equivalence - the alignment between the gold SQL query and the machine-generated SQL query. A machine-generated SQL query is logically equivalent to the gold query if these two queries would RETURN THE SAME RESULTS AND IN THE SAME ORDER for ALL POSSIBLE DATABASE INSTANCES that satisfy the provided database schema for these queries. Annotators were asked to penalize machine-generated queries that overlooked edge cases that the gold queries would have caught otherwise.



Evaluation steps:

1. Understand the Database Schema: Identify all tables used in both queries. List all columns referenced, along with their data types and constraints. Determine primary and foreign key relationships. Note any indexes or unique constraints that may affect query execution.
2. Parse and Break Down Each Query: Identify selected columns, functions, and expressions. Note the tables involved and the join conditions. Understand the filtering conditions applied. Identify grouping and aggregate conditions, if any. Determine if result ordering affects equivalence.
3. Compare Query Components: Check if both queries use the same tables and join conditions. Compare filtering conditions in the WHERE clauses. Assess whether the same columns and expressions are selected. Identify if different functions or syntaxes achieve the same result. Look for logical equivalence in expressions and calculations.
4. Consider Edge Cases and Data Variations: Conceptualize sample datasets that include edge cases (e.g., NULL values, zero values, special characters). Analyze how each query handles these edge cases. Ensure that data type differences do not affect the outcome. Verify that constraints (e.g., NOT NULL, UNIQUE) are accounted for.
5. Evaluate Aggregations and Calculations: Confirm that aggregate functions (e.g., SUM, COUNT) are applied identically. Ensure calculations (e.g., subtraction, addition) produce the same results.
6. Check for Logical Equivalence in Conditional Expressions: Compare conditional expressions like IIF, CASE WHEN, and IF. Determine if conditions and returned values are logically the same.
7. Assess Ordering of Results: If ORDER BY clause is present, confirm that both queries order results identically. Recognize that differing order may affect equivalence if result order is significant.
8. Generate a New Logical Equivalence Rule (If Applicable): Create an "Equivalent Queries: <query1>
<query2>
Schema Conditions:<conditions>" statement that defines the equivalence. Use GENERALIZED COLUMN and TABLE NAMES. Specify any necessary conditions based on the database schema. Present the rule clearly, indicating both the equivalence and the conditions under which it holds.



Example Equivalence Rules:

<Rule1>
Equivalent Queries:
SELECT T2.col2 FROM table1 AS T1 INNER JOIN table2 AS T2 ON T1.col1 = T2.col1 WHERE T1.col3 = 'value1' AND T1.col4 = 'value2';
SELECT table2.col2 FROM table2 INNER JOIN table1 ON table2.col1 = table1.col1 WHERE table1.col3 = 'value1' AND table1.col4 = 'value2';
Schema Conditions:
table1.col1 is a foreign key referencing table2.col1, and table2.col1 is a primary key.
</Rule1>

<Rule2>
Equivalent Queries:
SELECT CAST(SUM(IIF(condition, 1, 0)) AS FLOAT) / SUM(IIF(condition, 1, 0)) FROM table;
SELECT CAST(SUM(CASE WHEN condition THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS REAL) / SUM(CASE WHEN condition THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) FROM table;
Schema Conditions:
None.
</Rule2>

<Rule3>
Equivalent Queries:
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM table1 INNER JOIN table2 ON table1.col1 = table2.col2 WHERE condition;
SELECT COUNT(table1.col1) FROM table2 INNER JOIN table1 ON table2.col2 = table1.col1 WHERE condition;
Schema Conditions:
table1.col1 is a non-nullable column that uniquely identifies rows in table1.
</Rule3>

<Rule4>
Equivalent Queries:
SELECT CAST(SUM(IIF(condition, 1, 0)) AS FLOAT) * 100 / COUNT(column) FROM table1 INNER JOIN table2 ON table1.col1 = table2.col1 WHERE table1.date_col = 'date_value';
SELECT CAST(SUM(CASE WHEN condition THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS REAL) * 100 / COUNT(column) FROM table2 INNER JOIN table1 ON table2.col1 = table1.col1 WHERE table1.date_col = 'date_value';
Schema Conditions:
table1.col1 is a foreign key referencing table2.col1, and table2.col1 is a primary key.
</Rule4>

<Rule5>
Equivalent Queries:
SELECT SUM(IIF(condition1, expr1, 0)) - SUM(IIF(condition2, expr2, 0)) FROM table;
SELECT SUM(CASE WHEN condition1 THEN expr1 ELSE 0 END) - SUM(CASE WHEN condition2 THEN expr2 ELSE 0 END) FROM table;
Schema Conditions:
None.
</Rule5>

<Rule6>
Equivalent Queries:
SELECT COUNT(table1.col1) FROM table1 INNER JOIN table2 ON table1.col1 = table2.col2 INNER JOIN table3 ON table2.col3 = table3.col4 WHERE table1.condition1 = 'value' AND table3.condition2 = 'value';
SELECT COUNT(table3.col4) FROM table3 INNER JOIN table2 ON table3.col4 = table2.col3 INNER JOIN table1 ON table2.col2 = table1.col1 WHERE table1.condition1 = 'value' AND table3.condition2 = 'value';
Schema Conditions:
table1.col1 is a primary key, table3.col4 is a primary key, and table2.col2 and table2.col3 are foreign keys referencing table1.col1 and table3.col4 respectively.
</Rule6>

<Rule7>
Equivalent Queries:
SELECT ... FROM table WHERE condition1 AND condition2;
SELECT ... FROM table WHERE condition2 AND condition1;
Schema Conditions:
None.
</Rule7>



# Guidelines:
- Make SURE complete to every step PERFECTLY without ANY Mistakes
- Follow the Rules I Gave you and Remember to AVOID generating repeated equivalence rules in the examples I gave you.
- Be sure to format your response like the example equivalence rules I gave you.
- Put <New Rule></New Rule> around the new equivalence rule that you think of. Do not use other formatting around the equivalent queries.
- Use GENERALIZED COLUMN AND TABLE NAMES in any EQUIVALENCE RULE YOU WRITE. DO NOT USE THE SAME NAMES IN THE PROVIDED QUERY PAIRS!!!!
- If the two queries are not logically equivalent, say <New Rule> Not equivalent </New Rule>.
- If the new equivalence rule is already repeated in the examples listed, say <New Rule> Rule exists </New Rule>.
- The new rule should be be MINIMAL to CLEARLY demonstrate the highlighted semantic difference. Use ellipses to shorten SQL queries where necessary to achieve this.

Take a Deep Breath and Carefully Follow the Rules, Guides and Examples I gave you. I will tip you $2000 if you do EVERYTHING Perfectly.

A machine-generated SQL query is logically equivalent to the gold query if these two queries would RETURN THE SAME RESULTS AND IN THE SAME ORDER for ALL POSSIBLE DATABASE INSTANCES that satisfy the provided database schema for these queries. Annotators were asked to penalize machine-generated queries that overlooked edge cases that the gold queries would have caught otherwise.



Evaluation steps:

1. Understand the Database Schema: Identify all tables used in both queries. List all columns referenced, along with their data types and constraints. Determine primary and foreign key relationships. Note any indexes or unique constraints that may affect query execution.
2. Parse and Break Down Each Query: Identify selected columns, functions, and expressions. Note the tables involved and the join conditions. Understand the filtering conditions applied. Identify grouping and aggregate conditions, if any. Determine if result ordering affects equivalence.
3. Compare Query Components: Check if both queries use the same tables and join conditions. Compare filtering conditions in the WHERE clauses. Assess whether the same columns and expressions are selected. Identify if different functions or syntaxes achieve the same result. Look for logical equivalence in expressions and calculations.
4. Consider Edge Cases and Data Variations: Conceptualize sample datasets that include edge cases (e.g., NULL values, zero values, special characters). Analyze how each query handles these edge cases. Ensure that data type differences do not affect the outcome. Verify that constraints (e.g., NOT NULL, UNIQUE) are accounted for.
5. Evaluate Aggregations and Calculations: Confirm that aggregate functions (e.g., SUM, COUNT) are applied identically. Ensure calculations (e.g., subtraction, addition) produce the same results.
6. Check for Logical Equivalence in Conditional Expressions: Compare conditional expressions like IIF, CASE WHEN, and IF. Determine if conditions and returned values are logically the same.
7. Assess Ordering of Results: If ORDER BY clause is present, confirm that both queries order results identically. Recognize that differing order may affect equivalence if result order is significant.
8. Generate a New Logical Equivalence Rule (If Applicable): Create an "Equivalent Queries: <query1>
<query2>
Schema Conditions:<conditions>" statement that defines the equivalence. Use GENERALIZED COLUMN and TABLE NAMES. Specify any necessary conditions based on the database schema. Present the rule clearly, indicating both the equivalence and the conditions under which it holds.



Example Equivalence Rules:

<Rule1>
Equivalent Queries:
SELECT CAST(SUM(IIF(condition, 1, 0)) AS FLOAT) / SUM(IIF(condition, 1, 0)) FROM table;
SELECT CAST(SUM(CASE WHEN condition THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS REAL) / SUM(CASE WHEN condition THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) FROM table;
Schema Conditions:
None.
</Rule1>

<Rule2>
Equivalent Queries:
SELECT ... FROM table WHERE condition1 AND condition2;
SELECT ... FROM table WHERE condition2 AND condition1;
Schema Conditions:
None.
</Rule2>

<Rule3>
Equivalent Queries:
SELECT COUNT(table1.col1) FROM table1 INNER JOIN table2 ON table1.col1 = table2.col2 INNER JOIN table3 ON table2.col3 = table3.col4 WHERE table1.condition1 = 'value' AND table3.condition2 = 'value';
SELECT COUNT(table3.col4) FROM table3 INNER JOIN table2 ON table3.col4 = table2.col3 INNER JOIN table1 ON table2.col2 = table1.col1 WHERE table1.condition1 = 'value' AND table3.condition2 = 'value';
Schema Conditions:
table1.col1 is a primary key, table3.col4 is a primary key, and table2.col2 and table2.col3 are foreign keys referencing table1.col1 and table3.col4 respectively.
</Rule3>

<Rule4>
Equivalent Queries:
SELECT T2.col2 FROM table1 AS T1 INNER JOIN table2 AS T2 ON T1.col1 = T2.col1 WHERE T1.col3 = 'value1' AND T1.col4 = 'value2';
SELECT table2.col2 FROM table2 INNER JOIN table1 ON table2.col1 = table1.col1 WHERE table1.col3 = 'value1' AND table1.col4 = 'value2';
Schema Conditions:
table1.col1 is a foreign key referencing table2.col1, and table2.col1 is a primary key.
</Rule4>

<Rule5>
Equivalent Queries:
SELECT SUM(IIF(condition1, expr1, 0)) - SUM(IIF(condition2, expr2, 0)) FROM table;
SELECT SUM(CASE WHEN condition1 THEN expr1 ELSE 0 END) - SUM(CASE WHEN condition2 THEN expr2 ELSE 0 END) FROM table;
Schema Conditions:
None.
</Rule5>

<Rule6>
Equivalent Queries:
SELECT CAST(SUM(IIF(condition, 1, 0)) AS FLOAT) * 100 / COUNT(column) FROM table1 INNER JOIN table2 ON table1.col1 = table2.col1 WHERE table1.date_col = 'date_value';
SELECT CAST(SUM(CASE WHEN condition THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS REAL) * 100 / COUNT(column) FROM table2 INNER JOIN table1 ON table2.col1 = table1.col1 WHERE table1.date_col = 'date_value';
Schema Conditions:
table1.col1 is a foreign key referencing table2.col1, and table2.col1 is a primary key.
</Rule6>

<Rule7>
Equivalent Queries:
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM table1 INNER JOIN table2 ON table1.col1 = table2.col2 WHERE condition;
SELECT COUNT(table1.col1) FROM table2 INNER JOIN table1 ON table2.col2 = table1.col1 WHERE condition;
Schema Conditions:
table1.col1 is a non-nullable column that uniquely identifies rows in table1.
</Rule7>



# Guidelines:
- Make SURE complete to every step PERFECTLY without ANY Mistakes
- Follow the Rules I Gave you and Remember to AVOID generating repeated equivalence rules in the examples I gave you.
- Be sure to format your response like the example equivalence rules I gave you.
- Put <New Rule></New Rule> around the new equivalence rule that you think of. Do not use other formatting around the equivalent queries.
- Use GENERALIZED COLUMN AND TABLE NAMES in any EQUIVALENCE RULE YOU WRITE. DO NOT USE THE SAME NAMES IN THE PROVIDED QUERY PAIRS!!!!
- If the two queries are not logically equivalent, say <New Rule> Not equivalent </New Rule>.
- If the new equivalence rule is already repeated in the examples listed, say <New Rule> Rule exists </New Rule>.
- The new rule should be be MINIMAL to CLEARLY demonstrate the highlighted semantic difference. Use ellipses to shorten SQL queries where necessary to achieve this.

Take a Deep Breath and Carefully Follow the Rules, Guides and Examples I gave you. I will tip you $2000 if you do EVERYTHING Perfectly.

INFO:root:prompt: You are an expert SQL engineer with 20+ years of experience. You will be given some SQL equivalence rules conditional on some database schemas. You will then be given a pair of SQL queries, consisting of a gold query and a machine-generated query, and a database schema that defines the context of the queries. 

Your task is to compare the two provided SQL queries on logical equivalence and generate one more equivalence rule in the same format as the provided example equivalence rules.

Please make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please also keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.

Logical equivalence - the alignment between the gold SQL query and the machine-generated SQL query. A machine-generated SQL query is logically equivalent to the gold query if these two queries would RETURN THE SAME RESULTS AND IN THE SAME ORDER for ALL POSSIBLE DATABASE INSTANCES that satisfy the provided database schema for these queries.

INFO:root:model: gpt-4o
INFO:root:prompt: You are an expert SQL engineer with 20+ years of experience. You will be given some SQL equivalence rules conditional on some database schemas. You will then be given a pair of SQL queries, consisting of a gold query and a machine-generated query, and a database schema that defines the context of the queries. 

Your task is to compare the two provided SQL queries on logical equivalence and generate one more equivalence rule in the same format as the provided example equivalence rules.

Please make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please also keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.



Evaluation Criteria:

Logical equivalence - the alignment between the gold SQL query and the machine-generated SQL query. A machine-generated SQL query is logically equivalent to the gold query if these two queries would RETURN THE SAME RESULTS AND IN THE SAME ORDER for ALL POSSIBLE DATABASE INSTANCES that satisfy the provided database schema for these queries. Annotators were asked to penalize machine-generated queries that overlooked edge cases that the gold queries would have caught otherwise.



Evaluation steps:

1. Understand the Database Schema: Identify all tables used in both queries. List all columns referenced, along with their data types and constraints. Determine primary and foreign key relationships. Note any indexes or unique constraints that may affect query execution.
2. Parse and Break Down Each Query: Identify selected columns, functions, and expressions. Note the tables involved and the join conditions. Understand the filtering conditions applied. Identify grouping and aggregate conditions, if any. Determine if result ordering affects equivalence.
3. Compare Query Components: Check if both queries use the same tables and join conditions. Compare filtering conditions in the WHERE clauses. Assess whether the same columns and expressions are selected. Identify if different functions or syntaxes achieve the same result. Look for logical equivalence in expressions and calculations.
4. Consider Edge Cases and Data Variations: Conceptualize sample datasets that include edge cases (e.g., NULL values, zero values, special characters). Analyze how each query handles these edge cases. Ensure that data type differences do not affect the outcome. Verify that constraints (e.g., NOT NULL, UNIQUE) are accounted for.
5. Evaluate Aggregations and Calculations: Confirm that aggregate functions (e.g., SUM, COUNT) are applied identically. Ensure calculations (e.g., subtraction, addition) produce the same results.
6. Check for Logical Equivalence in Conditional Expressions: Compare conditional expressions like IIF, CASE WHEN, and IF. Determine if conditions and returned values are logically the same.
7. Assess Ordering of Results: If ORDER BY clause is present, confirm that both queries order results identically. Recognize that differing order may affect equivalence if result order is significant.
8. Generate a New Logical Equivalence Rule (If Applicable): Create an "Equivalent Queries: <query1>
<query2>
Schema Conditions:<conditions>" statement that defines the equivalence. Use GENERALIZED COLUMN and TABLE NAMES. Specify any necessary conditions based on the database schema. Present the rule clearly, indicating both the equivalence and the conditions under which it holds.



Example Equivalence Rules:

<Rule1>
Equivalent Queries:
SELECT COUNT(table1.col1) FROM table1 INNER JOIN table2 ON table1.col1 = table2.col2 INNER JOIN table3 ON table2.col3 = table3.col4 WHERE table1.condition1 = 'value' AND table3.condition2 = 'value';
SELECT COUNT(table3.col4) FROM table3 INNER JOIN table2 ON table3.col4 = table2.col3 INNER JOIN table1 ON table2.col2 = table1.col1 WHERE table1.condition1 = 'value' AND table3.condition2 = 'value';
Schema Conditions:
table1.col1 is a primary key, table3.col4 is a primary key, and table2.col2 and table2.col3 are foreign keys referencing table1.col1 and table3.col4 respectively.
</Rule1>

<Rule2>
Equivalent Queries:
SELECT SUM(IIF(condition1, expr1, 0)) - SUM(IIF(condition2, expr2, 0)) FROM table;
SELECT SUM(CASE WHEN condition1 THEN expr1 ELSE 0 END) - SUM(CASE WHEN condition2 THEN expr2 ELSE 0 END) FROM table;
Schema Conditions:
None.
</Rule2>

<Rule3>
Equivalent Queries:
SELECT CAST(SUM(IIF(condition, 1, 0)) AS FLOAT) / SUM(IIF(condition, 1, 0)) FROM table;
SELECT CAST(SUM(CASE WHEN condition THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS REAL) / SUM(CASE WHEN condition THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) FROM table;
Schema Conditions:
None.
</Rule3>

<Rule4>
Equivalent Queries:
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM table1 INNER JOIN table2 ON table1.col1 = table2.col2 WHERE condition;
SELECT COUNT(table1.col1) FROM table2 INNER JOIN table1 ON table2.col2 = table1.col1 WHERE condition;
Schema Conditions:
table1.col1 is a non-nullable column that uniquely identifies rows in table1.
</Rule4>

<Rule5>
Equivalent Queries:
SELECT ... FROM table WHERE condition1 AND condition2;
SELECT ... FROM table WHERE condition2 AND condition1;
Schema Conditions:
None.
</Rule5>

<Rule6>
Equivalent Queries:
SELECT T2.col2 FROM table1 AS T1 INNER JOIN table2 AS T2 ON T1.col1 = T2.col1 WHERE T1.col3 = 'value1' AND T1.col4 = 'value2';
SELECT table2.col2 FROM table2 INNER JOIN table1 ON table2.col1 = table1.col1 WHERE table1.col3 = 'value1' AND table1.col4 = 'value2';
Schema Conditions:
table1.col1 is a foreign key referencing table2.col1, and table2.col1 is a primary key.
</Rule6>

<Rule7>
Equivalent Queries:
SELECT CAST(SUM(IIF(condition, 1, 0)) AS FLOAT) * 100 / COUNT(column) FROM table1 INNER JOIN table2 ON table1.col1 = table2.col1 WHERE table1.date_col = 'date_value';
SELECT CAST(SUM(CASE WHEN condition THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS REAL) * 100 / COUNT(column) FROM table2 INNER JOIN table1 ON table2.col1 = table1.col1 WHERE table1.date_col = 'date_value';
Schema Conditions:
table1.col1 is a foreign key referencing table2.col1, and table2.col1 is a primary key.
</Rule7>



# Guidelines:
- Make SURE complete to every step PERFECTLY without ANY Mistakes
- Follow the Rules I Gave you and Remember to AVOID generating repeated equivalence rules in the examples I gave you.
- Be sure to format your response like the example equivalence rules I gave you.
- Put <New Rule></New Rule> around the new equivalence rule that you think of. Do not use other formatting around the equivalent queries.
- Use GENERALIZED COLUMN AND TABLE NAMES in any EQUIVALENCE RULE YOU WRITE. DO NOT USE THE SAME NAMES IN THE PROVIDED QUERY PAIRS!!!!
- If the two queries are not logically equivalent, say <New Rule> Not equivalent </New Rule>.
- If the new equivalence rule is already repeated in the examples listed, say <New Rule> Rule exists </New Rule>.
- The new rule should be be MINIMAL to CLEARLY demonstrate the highlighted semantic difference. Use ellipses to shorten SQL queries where necessary to achieve this.

Take a Deep Breath and Carefully Follow the Rules, Guides and Examples I gave you. I will tip you $2000 if you do EVERYTHING Perfectly.

INFO:root:model: gpt-4o
INFO:root:prompt: You are an expert SQL engineer with 20+ years of experience. You will be given some SQL equivalence rules conditional on some database schemas. You will then be given a pair of SQL queries, consisting of a gold query and a machine-generated query, and a database schema that defines the context of the queries. 

Your task is to compare the two provided SQL queries on logical equivalence and generate one more equivalence rule in the same format as the provided example equivalence rules.

Please make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please also keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.



Evaluation Criteria:

Logical equivalence - the alignment between the gold SQL query and the machine-generated SQL query. A machine-generated SQL query is logically equivalent to the gold query if these two queries would RETURN THE SAME RESULTS AND IN THE SAME ORDER for ALL POSSIBLE DATABASE INSTANCES that satisfy the provided database schema for these queries. Annotators were asked to penalize machine-generated queries that overlooked edge cases that the gold queries would have caught otherwise.



Evaluation steps:

1. Understand the Database Schema: Identify all tables used in both queries. List all columns referenced, along with their data types and constraints. Determine primary and foreign key relationships. Note any indexes or unique constraints that may affect query execution.
2. Parse and Break Down Each Query: Identify selected columns, functions, and expressions. Note the tables involved and the join conditions. Understand the filtering conditions applied. Identify grouping and aggregate conditions, if any. Determine if result ordering affects equivalence.
3. Compare Query Components: Check if both queries use the same tables and join conditions. Compare filtering conditions in the WHERE clauses. Assess whether the same columns and expressions are selected. Identify if different functions or syntaxes achieve the same result. Look for logical equivalence in expressions and calculations.
4. Consider Edge Cases and Data Variations: Conceptualize sample datasets that include edge cases (e.g., NULL values, zero values, special characters). Analyze how each query handles these edge cases. Ensure that data type differences do not affect the outcome. Verify that constraints (e.g., NOT NULL, UNIQUE) are accounted for.
5. Evaluate Aggregations and Calculations: Confirm that aggregate functions (e.g., SUM, COUNT) are applied identically. Ensure calculations (e.g., subtraction, addition) produce the same results.
6. Check for Logical Equivalence in Conditional Expressions: Compare conditional expressions like IIF, CASE WHEN, and IF. Determine if conditions and returned values are logically the same.
7. Assess Ordering of Results: If ORDER BY clause is present, confirm that both queries order results identically. Recognize that differing order may affect equivalence if result order is significant.
8. Generate a New Logical Equivalence Rule (If Applicable): Create an "Equivalent Queries: <query1>
<query2>
Schema Conditions:<conditions>" statement that defines the equivalence. Use GENERALIZED COLUMN and TABLE NAMES. Specify any necessary conditions based on the database schema. Present the rule clearly, indicating both the equivalence and the conditions under which it holds.



Example Equivalence Rules:

<Rule1>
Equivalent Queries:
SELECT CAST(SUM(IIF(condition, 1, 0)) AS FLOAT) / SUM(IIF(condition, 1, 0)) FROM table;
SELECT CAST(SUM(CASE WHEN condition THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS REAL) / SUM(CASE WHEN condition THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) FROM table;
Schema Conditions:
None.
</Rule1>

<Rule2>
Equivalent Queries:
SELECT COUNT(table1.col1) FROM table1 INNER JOIN table2 ON table1.col1 = table2.col2 INNER JOIN table3 ON table2.col3 = table3.col4 WHERE table1.condition1 = 'value' AND table3.condition2 = 'value';
SELECT COUNT(table3.col4) FROM table3 INNER JOIN table2 ON table3.col4 = table2.col3 INNER JOIN table1 ON table2.col2 = table1.col1 WHERE table1.condition1 = 'value' AND table3.condition2 = 'value';
Schema Conditions:
table1.col1 is a primary key, table3.col4 is a primary key, and table2.col2 and table2.col3 are foreign keys referencing table1.col1 and table3.col4 respectively.
</Rule2>

<Rule3>
Equivalent Queries:
SELECT CAST(SUM(IIF(condition, 1, 0)) AS FLOAT) * 100 / COUNT(column) FROM table1 INNER JOIN table2 ON table1.col1 = table2.col1 WHERE table1.date_col = 'date_value';
SELECT CAST(SUM(CASE WHEN condition THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS REAL) * 100 / COUNT(column) FROM table2 INNER JOIN table1 ON table2.col1 = table1.col1 WHERE table1.date_col = 'date_value';
Schema Conditions:
table1.col1 is a foreign key referencing table2.col1, and table2.col1 is a primary key.
</Rule3>

<Rule4>
Equivalent Queries:
SELECT SUM(IIF(condition1, expr1, 0)) - SUM(IIF(condition2, expr2, 0)) FROM table;
SELECT SUM(CASE WHEN condition1 THEN expr1 ELSE 0 END) - SUM(CASE WHEN condition2 THEN expr2 ELSE 0 END) FROM table;
Schema Conditions:
None.
</Rule4>

<Rule5>
Equivalent Queries:
SELECT T2.col2 FROM table1 AS T1 INNER JOIN table2 AS T2 ON T1.col1 = T2.col1 WHERE T1.col3 = 'value1' AND T1.col4 = 'value2';
SELECT table2.col2 FROM table2 INNER JOIN table1 ON table2.col1 = table1.col1 WHERE table1.col3 = 'value1' AND table1.col4 = 'value2';
Schema Conditions:
table1.col1 is a foreign key referencing table2.col1, and table2.col1 is a primary key.
</Rule5>

<Rule6>
Equivalent Queries:
SELECT ... FROM table WHERE condition1 AND condition2;
SELECT ... FROM table WHERE condition2 AND condition1;
Schema Conditions:
None.
</Rule6>

<Rule7>
Equivalent Queries:
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM table1 INNER JOIN table2 ON table1.col1 = table2.col2 WHERE condition;
SELECT COUNT(table1.col1) FROM table2 INNER JOIN table1 ON table2.col2 = table1.col1 WHERE condition;
Schema Conditions:
table1.col1 is a non-nullable column that uniquely identifies rows in table1.
</Rule7>



# Guidelines:
- Make SURE complete to every step PERFECTLY without ANY Mistakes
- Follow the Rules I Gave you and Remember to AVOID generating repeated equivalence rules in the examples I gave you.
- Be sure to format your response like the example equivalence rules I gave you.
- Put <New Rule></New Rule> around the new equivalence rule that you think of. Do not use other formatting around the equivalent queries.
- Use GENERALIZED COLUMN AND TABLE NAMES in any EQUIVALENCE RULE YOU WRITE. DO NOT USE THE SAME NAMES IN THE PROVIDED QUERY PAIRS!!!!
- If the two queries are not logically equivalent, say <New Rule> Not equivalent </New Rule>.
- If the new equivalence rule is already repeated in the examples listed, say <New Rule> Rule exists </New Rule>.
- The new rule should be be MINIMAL to CLEARLY demonstrate the highlighted semantic difference. Use ellipses to shorten SQL queries where necessary to achieve this.

Take a Deep Breath and Carefully Follow the Rules, Guides and Examples I gave you. I will tip you $2000 if you do EVERYTHING Perfectly.

INFO:root:prompt: You are an expert SQL engineer with 20+ years of experience. You will be given some SQL equivalence rules conditional on some database schemas. You will then be given a pair of SQL queries, consisting of a gold query and a machine-generated query, and a database schema that defines the context of the queries. 

Your task is to compare the two provided SQL queries on logical equivalence and generate one more equivalence rule in the same format as the provided example equivalence rules.

Please make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please also keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.



Evaluation Criteria:

Logical equivalence - the alignment between the gold SQL query and the machine-generated SQL query. A machine-generated SQL query is logically equivalent to the gold query if these two queries would RETURN THE SAME RESULTS AND IN THE SAME ORDER for ALL POSSIBLE DATABASE INSTANCES that satisfy the provided database schema for these queries. Annotators were asked to penalize machine-generated queries that overlooked edge cases that the gold queries would have caught otherwise.



Evaluation steps:

1. Understand the Database Schema: Identify all tables used in both queries. List all columns referenced, along with their data types and constraints. Determine primary and foreign key relationships. Note any indexes or unique constraints that may affect query execution.
2. Parse and Break Down Each Query: Identify selected columns, functions, and expressions. Note the tables involved and the join conditions. Understand the filtering conditions applied. Identify grouping and aggregate conditions, if any. Determine if result ordering affects equivalence.
3. Compare Query Components: Check if both queries use the same tables and join conditions. Compare filtering conditions in the WHERE clauses. Assess whether the same columns and expressions are selected. Identify if different functions or syntaxes achieve the same result. Look for logical equivalence in expressions and calculations.
4. Consider Edge Cases and Data Variations: Conceptualize sample datasets that include edge cases (e.g., NULL values, zero values, special characters). Analyze how each query handles these edge cases. Ensure that data type differences do not affect the outcome. Verify that constraints (e.g., NOT NULL, UNIQUE) are accounted for.
5. Evaluate Aggregations and Calculations: Confirm that aggregate functions (e.g., SUM, COUNT) are applied identically. Ensure calculations (e.g., subtraction, addition) produce the same results.
6. Check for Logical Equivalence in Conditional Expressions: Compare conditional expressions like IIF, CASE WHEN, and IF. Determine if conditions and returned values are logically the same.
7. Assess Ordering of Results: If ORDER BY clause is present, confirm that both queries order results identically. Recognize that differing order may affect equivalence if result order is significant.
8. Generate a New Logical Equivalence Rule (If Applicable): Create an "Equivalent Queries: <query1>
<query2>
Schema Conditions:<conditions>" statement that defines the equivalence. Use GENERALIZED COLUMN and TABLE NAMES. Specify any necessary conditions based on the database schema. Present the rule clearly, indicating both the equivalence and the conditions under which it holds.



Example Equivalence Rules:

<Rule1>
Equivalent Queries:
SELECT T2.col2 FROM table1 AS T1 INNER JOIN table2 AS T2 ON T1.col1 = T2.col1 WHERE T1.col3 = 'value1' AND T1.col4 = 'value2';
SELECT table2.col2 FROM table2 INNER JOIN table1 ON table2.col1 = table1.col1 WHERE table1.col3 = 'value1' AND table1.col4 = 'value2';
Schema Conditions:
table1.col1 is a foreign key referencing table2.col1, and table2.col1 is a primary key.
</Rule1>

<Rule2>
Equivalent Queries:
SELECT T1.col1, T2.col2 FROM table1 AS T1 INNER JOIN table2 AS T2 ON T1.col3 = T2.col3 WHERE T1.col3 = value;
SELECT table1.col1, table2.col2 FROM table1 INNER JOIN table2 ON table1.col3 = table2.col3 WHERE table1.col3 = value;
Schema Conditions:
table1.col3 is a primary key, and table2.col3 is a foreign key referencing table1.col3.
</Rule2>

<Rule3>
Equivalent Queries:
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM table1 INNER JOIN table2 ON table1.col1 = table2.col2 WHERE condition;
SELECT COUNT(table1.col1) FROM table2 INNER JOIN table1 ON table2.col2 = table1.col1 WHERE condition;
Schema Conditions:
table1.col1 is a non-nullable column that uniquely identifies rows in table1.
</Rule3>

<Rule4>
Equivalent Queries:
SELECT CAST(SUM(IIF(condition, 1, 0)) AS FLOAT) * 100 / COUNT(column) FROM table1 INNER JOIN table2 ON table1.col1 = table2.col1 WHERE table1.date_col = 'date_value';
SELECT CAST(SUM(CASE WHEN condition THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS REAL) * 100 / COUNT(column) FROM table2 INNER JOIN table1 ON table2.col1 = table1.col1 WHERE table1.date_col = 'date_value';
Schema Conditions:
table1.col1 is a foreign key referencing table2.col1, and table2.col1 is a primary key.
</Rule4>

<Rule5>
Equivalent Queries:
SELECT CAST(SUM(IIF(condition, 1, 0)) AS FLOAT) / SUM(IIF(condition, 1, 0)) FROM table;
SELECT CAST(SUM(CASE WHEN condition THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS REAL) / SUM(CASE WHEN condition THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) FROM table;
Schema Conditions:
None.
</Rule5>

<Rule6>
Equivalent Queries:
SELECT SUM(IIF(condition1, expr1, 0)) - SUM(IIF(condition2, expr2, 0)) FROM table;
SELECT SUM(CASE WHEN condition1 THEN expr1 ELSE 0 END) - SUM(CASE WHEN condition2 THEN expr2 ELSE 0 END) FROM table;
Schema Conditions:
None.
</Rule6>

<Rule7>
Equivalent Queries:
SELECT ... FROM table WHERE condition1 AND condition2;
SELECT ... FROM table WHERE condition2 AND condition1;
Schema Conditions:
None.
</Rule7>

<Rule8>
Equivalent Queries:
SELECT COUNT(table1.col1) FROM table1 INNER JOIN table2 ON table1.col1 = table2.col2 INNER JOIN table3 ON table2.col3 = table3.col4 WHERE table1.condition1 = 'value' AND table3.condition2 = 'value';
SELECT COUNT(table3.col4) FROM table3 INNER JOIN table2 ON table3.col4 = table2.col3 INNER JOIN table1 ON table2.col2 = table1.col1 WHERE table1.condition1 = 'value' AND table3.condition2 = 'value';
Schema Conditions:
table1.col1 is a primary key, table3.col4 is a primary key, and table2.col2 and table2.col3 are foreign keys referencing table1.col1 and table3.col4 respectively.
</Rule8>



# Guidelines:
- Make SURE complete to every step PERFECTLY without ANY Mistakes
- Follow the Rules I Gave you and Remember to AVOID generating repeated equivalence rules in the examples I gave you.
- Be sure to format your response like the example equivalence rules I gave you.
- Put <New Rule></New Rule> around the new equivalence rule that you think of. Do not use other formatting around the equivalent queries.
- Use GENERALIZED COLUMN AND TABLE NAMES in any EQUIVALENCE RULE YOU WRITE. DO NOT USE THE SAME NAMES IN THE PROVIDED QUERY PAIRS!!!!
- If the two queries are not logically equivalent, say <New Rule> Not equivalent </New Rule>.
- If the new equivalence rule is already repeated in the examples listed, say <New Rule> Rule exists </New Rule>.
- The new rule should be be MINIMAL to CLEARLY demonstrate the highlighted semantic difference. Use ellipses to shorten SQL queries where necessary to achieve this.

Take a Deep Breath and Carefully Follow the Rules, Guides and Examples I gave you. I will tip you $2000 if you do EVERYTHING Perfectly.

A machine-generated SQL query is logically equivalent to the gold query if these two queries would RETURN THE SAME RESULTS AND IN THE SAME ORDER for ALL POSSIBLE DATABASE INSTANCES that satisfy the provided database schema for these queries. Annotators were asked to penalize machine-generated queries that overlooked edge cases that the gold queries would have caught otherwise.



Evaluation steps:

1. Understand the Database Schema: Identify all tables used in both queries. List all columns referenced, along with their data types and constraints. Determine primary and foreign key relationships. Note any indexes or unique constraints that may affect query execution.
2. Parse and Break Down Each Query: Identify selected columns, functions, and expressions. Note the tables involved and the join conditions. Understand the filtering conditions applied. Identify grouping and aggregate conditions, if any. Determine if result ordering affects equivalence.
3. Compare Query Components: Check if both queries use the same tables and join conditions. Compare filtering conditions in the WHERE clauses. Assess whether the same columns and expressions are selected. Identify if different functions or syntaxes achieve the same result. Look for logical equivalence in expressions and calculations.
4. Consider Edge Cases and Data Variations: Conceptualize sample datasets that include edge cases (e.g., NULL values, zero values, special characters). Analyze how each query handles these edge cases. Ensure that data type differences do not affect the outcome. Verify that constraints (e.g., NOT NULL, UNIQUE) are accounted for.
5. Evaluate Aggregations and Calculations: Confirm that aggregate functions (e.g., SUM, COUNT) are applied identically. Ensure calculations (e.g., subtraction, addition) produce the same results.
6. Check for Logical Equivalence in Conditional Expressions: Compare conditional expressions like IIF, CASE WHEN, and IF. Determine if conditions and returned values are logically the same.
7. Assess Ordering of Results: If ORDER BY clause is present, confirm that both queries order results identically. Recognize that differing order may affect equivalence if result order is significant.
8. Generate a New Logical Equivalence Rule (If Applicable): Create an "Equivalent Queries: <query1>
<query2>
Schema Conditions:<conditions>" statement that defines the equivalence. Use GENERALIZED COLUMN and TABLE NAMES. Specify any necessary conditions based on the database schema. Present the rule clearly, indicating both the equivalence and the conditions under which it holds.



Example Equivalence Rules:

<Rule1>
Equivalent Queries:
SELECT COUNT(table1.col1) FROM table1 INNER JOIN table2 ON table1.col1 = table2.col2 INNER JOIN table3 ON table2.col3 = table3.col4 WHERE table1.condition1 = 'value' AND table3.condition2 = 'value';
SELECT COUNT(table3.col4) FROM table3 INNER JOIN table2 ON table3.col4 = table2.col3 INNER JOIN table1 ON table2.col2 = table1.col1 WHERE table1.condition1 = 'value' AND table3.condition2 = 'value';
Schema Conditions:
table1.col1 is a primary key, table3.col4 is a primary key, and table2.col2 and table2.col3 are foreign keys referencing table1.col1 and table3.col4 respectively.
</Rule1>

<Rule2>
Equivalent Queries:
SELECT CAST(SUM(IIF(condition, 1, 0)) AS FLOAT) / SUM(IIF(condition, 1, 0)) FROM table;
SELECT CAST(SUM(CASE WHEN condition THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS REAL) / SUM(CASE WHEN condition THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) FROM table;
Schema Conditions:
None.
</Rule2>

<Rule3>
Equivalent Queries:
SELECT SUM(IIF(condition1, expr1, 0)) - SUM(IIF(condition2, expr2, 0)) FROM table;
SELECT SUM(CASE WHEN condition1 THEN expr1 ELSE 0 END) - SUM(CASE WHEN condition2 THEN expr2 ELSE 0 END) FROM table;
Schema Conditions:
None.
</Rule3>

<Rule4>
Equivalent Queries:
SELECT CAST(SUM(IIF(condition, 1, 0)) AS FLOAT) * 100 / COUNT(column) FROM table1 INNER JOIN table2 ON table1.col1 = table2.col1 WHERE table1.date_col = 'date_value';
SELECT CAST(SUM(CASE WHEN condition THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS REAL) * 100 / COUNT(column) FROM table2 INNER JOIN table1 ON table2.col1 = table1.col1 WHERE table1.date_col = 'date_value';
Schema Conditions:
table1.col1 is a foreign key referencing table2.col1, and table2.col1 is a primary key.
</Rule4>

<Rule5>
Equivalent Queries:
SELECT T2.col2 FROM table1 AS T1 INNER JOIN table2 AS T2 ON T1.col1 = T2.col1 WHERE T1.col3 = 'value1' AND T1.col4 = 'value2';
SELECT table2.col2 FROM table2 INNER JOIN table1 ON table2.col1 = table1.col1 WHERE table1.col3 = 'value1' AND table1.col4 = 'value2';
Schema Conditions:
table1.col1 is a foreign key referencing table2.col1, and table2.col1 is a primary key.
</Rule5>

<Rule6>
Equivalent Queries:
SELECT T1.col1, T2.col2 FROM table1 AS T1 INNER JOIN table2 AS T2 ON T1.col3 = T2.col3 WHERE T1.col3 = value;
SELECT table1.col1, table2.col2 FROM table1 INNER JOIN table2 ON table1.col3 = table2.col3 WHERE table1.col3 = value;
Schema Conditions:
table1.col3 is a primary key, and table2.col3 is a foreign key referencing table1.col3.
</Rule6>

<Rule7>
Equivalent Queries:
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM table1 INNER JOIN table2 ON table1.col1 = table2.col2 WHERE condition;
SELECT COUNT(table1.col1) FROM table2 INNER JOIN table1 ON table2.col2 = table1.col1 WHERE condition;
Schema Conditions:
table1.col1 is a non-nullable column that uniquely identifies rows in table1.
</Rule7>

<Rule8>
Equivalent Queries:
SELECT ... FROM table WHERE condition1 AND condition2;
SELECT ... FROM table WHERE condition2 AND condition1;
Schema Conditions:
None.
</Rule8>



# Guidelines:
- Make SURE complete to every step PERFECTLY without ANY Mistakes
- Follow the Rules I Gave you and Remember to AVOID generating repeated equivalence rules in the examples I gave you.
- Be sure to format your response like the example equivalence rules I gave you.
- Put <New Rule></New Rule> around the new equivalence rule that you think of. Do not use other formatting around the equivalent queries.
- Use GENERALIZED COLUMN AND TABLE NAMES in any EQUIVALENCE RULE YOU WRITE. DO NOT USE THE SAME NAMES IN THE PROVIDED QUERY PAIRS!!!!
- If the two queries are not logically equivalent, say <New Rule> Not equivalent </New Rule>.
- If the new equivalence rule is already repeated in the examples listed, say <New Rule> Rule exists </New Rule>.
- The new rule should be be MINIMAL to CLEARLY demonstrate the highlighted semantic difference. Use ellipses to shorten SQL queries where necessary to achieve this.

Take a Deep Breath and Carefully Follow the Rules, Guides and Examples I gave you. I will tip you $2000 if you do EVERYTHING Perfectly.

INFO:root:model: gpt-4o
INFO:root:prompt: You are an expert SQL engineer with 20+ years of experience. You will be given some SQL equivalence rules conditional on some database schemas. You will then be given a pair of SQL queries, consisting of a gold query and a machine-generated query, and a database schema that defines the context of the queries. 

Your task is to compare the two provided SQL queries on logical equivalence and generate one more equivalence rule in the same format as the provided example equivalence rules.

Please make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please also keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.



Evaluation Criteria:

Logical equivalence - the alignment between the gold SQL query and the machine-generated SQL query. A machine-generated SQL query is logically equivalent to the gold query if these two queries would RETURN THE SAME RESULTS AND IN THE SAME ORDER for ALL POSSIBLE DATABASE INSTANCES that satisfy the provided database schema for these queries. Annotators were asked to penalize machine-generated queries that overlooked edge cases that the gold queries would have caught otherwise.



Evaluation steps:

1. Understand the Database Schema: Identify all tables used in both queries. List all columns referenced, along with their data types and constraints. Determine primary and foreign key relationships. Note any indexes or unique constraints that may affect query execution.
2. Parse and Break Down Each Query: Identify selected columns, functions, and expressions. Note the tables involved and the join conditions. Understand the filtering conditions applied. Identify grouping and aggregate conditions, if any. Determine if result ordering affects equivalence.
3. Compare Query Components: Check if both queries use the same tables and join conditions. Compare filtering conditions in the WHERE clauses. Assess whether the same columns and expressions are selected. Identify if different functions or syntaxes achieve the same result. Look for logical equivalence in expressions and calculations.
4. Consider Edge Cases and Data Variations: Conceptualize sample datasets that include edge cases (e.g., NULL values, zero values, special characters). Analyze how each query handles these edge cases. Ensure that data type differences do not affect the outcome. Verify that constraints (e.g., NOT NULL, UNIQUE) are accounted for.
5. Evaluate Aggregations and Calculations: Confirm that aggregate functions (e.g., SUM, COUNT) are applied identically. Ensure calculations (e.g., subtraction, addition) produce the same results.
6. Check for Logical Equivalence in Conditional Expressions: Compare conditional expressions like IIF, CASE WHEN, and IF. Determine if conditions and returned values are logically the same.
7. Assess Ordering of Results: If ORDER BY clause is present, confirm that both queries order results identically. Recognize that differing order may affect equivalence if result order is significant.
8. Generate a New Logical Equivalence Rule (If Applicable): Create an "Equivalent Queries: <query1>
<query2>
Schema Conditions:<conditions>" statement that defines the equivalence. Use GENERALIZED COLUMN and TABLE NAMES. Specify any necessary conditions based on the database schema. Present the rule clearly, indicating both the equivalence and the conditions under which it holds.



Example Equivalence Rules:

<Rule1>
Equivalent Queries:
SELECT CAST(SUM(IIF(condition, 1, 0)) AS FLOAT) / SUM(IIF(condition, 1, 0)) FROM table;
SELECT CAST(SUM(CASE WHEN condition THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS REAL) / SUM(CASE WHEN condition THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) FROM table;
Schema Conditions:
None.
</Rule1>

<Rule2>
Equivalent Queries:
SELECT ... FROM table WHERE condition1 AND condition2;
SELECT ... FROM table WHERE condition2 AND condition1;
Schema Conditions:
None.
</Rule2>

<Rule3>
Equivalent Queries:
SELECT SUM(IIF(condition1, expr1, 0)) - SUM(IIF(condition2, expr2, 0)) FROM table;
SELECT SUM(CASE WHEN condition1 THEN expr1 ELSE 0 END) - SUM(CASE WHEN condition2 THEN expr2 ELSE 0 END) FROM table;
Schema Conditions:
None.
</Rule3>

<Rule4>
Equivalent Queries:
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM table1 INNER JOIN table2 ON table1.col1 = table2.col2 WHERE condition;
SELECT COUNT(table1.col1) FROM table2 INNER JOIN table1 ON table2.col2 = table1.col1 WHERE condition;
Schema Conditions:
table1.col1 is a non-nullable column that uniquely identifies rows in table1.
</Rule4>

<Rule5>
Equivalent Queries:
SELECT COUNT(table1.col1) FROM table1 INNER JOIN table2 ON table1.col1 = table2.col2 INNER JOIN table3 ON table2.col3 = table3.col4 WHERE table1.condition1 = 'value' AND table3.condition2 = 'value';
SELECT COUNT(table3.col4) FROM table3 INNER JOIN table2 ON table3.col4 = table2.col3 INNER JOIN table1 ON table2.col2 = table1.col1 WHERE table1.condition1 = 'value' AND table3.condition2 = 'value';
Schema Conditions:
table1.col1 is a primary key, table3.col4 is a primary key, and table2.col2 and table2.col3 are foreign keys referencing table1.col1 and table3.col4 respectively.
</Rule5>

<Rule6>
Equivalent Queries:
SELECT T1.col1, T2.col2 FROM table1 AS T1 INNER JOIN table2 AS T2 ON T1.col3 = T2.col3 WHERE T1.col3 = value;
SELECT table1.col1, table2.col2 FROM table1 INNER JOIN table2 ON table1.col3 = table2.col3 WHERE table1.col3 = value;
Schema Conditions:
table1.col3 is a primary key, and table2.col3 is a foreign key referencing table1.col3.
</Rule6>

<Rule7>
Equivalent Queries:
SELECT CAST(SUM(IIF(condition, 1, 0)) AS FLOAT) * 100 / COUNT(column) FROM table1 INNER JOIN table2 ON table1.col1 = table2.col1 WHERE table1.date_col = 'date_value';
SELECT CAST(SUM(CASE WHEN condition THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS REAL) * 100 / COUNT(column) FROM table2 INNER JOIN table1 ON table2.col1 = table1.col1 WHERE table1.date_col = 'date_value';
Schema Conditions:
table1.col1 is a foreign key referencing table2.col1, and table2.col1 is a primary key.
</Rule7>

<Rule8>
Equivalent Queries:
SELECT T2.col2 FROM table1 AS T1 INNER JOIN table2 AS T2 ON T1.col1 = T2.col1 WHERE T1.col3 = 'value1' AND T1.col4 = 'value2';
SELECT table2.col2 FROM table2 INNER JOIN table1 ON table2.col1 = table1.col1 WHERE table1.col3 = 'value1' AND table1.col4 = 'value2';
Schema Conditions:
table1.col1 is a foreign key referencing table2.col1, and table2.col1 is a primary key.
</Rule8>



# Guidelines:
- Make SURE complete to every step PERFECTLY without ANY Mistakes
- Follow the Rules I Gave you and Remember to AVOID generating repeated equivalence rules in the examples I gave you.
- Be sure to format your response like the example equivalence rules I gave you.
- Put <New Rule></New Rule> around the new equivalence rule that you think of. Do not use other formatting around the equivalent queries.
- Use GENERALIZED COLUMN AND TABLE NAMES in any EQUIVALENCE RULE YOU WRITE. DO NOT USE THE SAME NAMES IN THE PROVIDED QUERY PAIRS!!!!
- If the two queries are not logically equivalent, say <New Rule> Not equivalent </New Rule>.
- If the new equivalence rule is already repeated in the examples listed, say <New Rule> Rule exists </New Rule>.
- The new rule should be be MINIMAL to CLEARLY demonstrate the highlighted semantic difference. Use ellipses to shorten SQL queries where necessary to achieve this.

Take a Deep Breath and Carefully Follow the Rules, Guides and Examples I gave you. I will tip you $2000 if you do EVERYTHING Perfectly.

INFO:root:model: gpt-4o
INFO:root:prompt: You are an expert SQL engineer with 20+ years of experience. You will be given some SQL equivalence rules conditional on some database schemas. You will then be given a pair of SQL queries, consisting of a gold query and a machine-generated query, and a database schema that defines the context of the queries. 

Your task is to compare the two provided SQL queries on logical equivalence and generate one more equivalence rule in the same format as the provided example equivalence rules.

Please make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please also keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.



Evaluation Criteria:

Logical equivalence - the alignment between the gold SQL query and the machine-generated SQL query. A machine-generated SQL query is logically equivalent to the gold query if these two queries would RETURN THE SAME RESULTS AND IN THE SAME ORDER for ALL POSSIBLE DATABASE INSTANCES that satisfy the provided database schema for these queries. Annotators were asked to penalize machine-generated queries that overlooked edge cases that the gold queries would have caught otherwise.



Evaluation steps:

1. Understand the Database Schema: Identify all tables used in both queries. List all columns referenced, along with their data types and constraints. Determine primary and foreign key relationships. Note any indexes or unique constraints that may affect query execution.
2. Parse and Break Down Each Query: Identify selected columns, functions, and expressions. Note the tables involved and the join conditions. Understand the filtering conditions applied. Identify grouping and aggregate conditions, if any. Determine if result ordering affects equivalence.
3. Compare Query Components: Check if both queries use the same tables and join conditions. Compare filtering conditions in the WHERE clauses. Assess whether the same columns and expressions are selected. Identify if different functions or syntaxes achieve the same result. Look for logical equivalence in expressions and calculations.
4. Consider Edge Cases and Data Variations: Conceptualize sample datasets that include edge cases (e.g., NULL values, zero values, special characters). Analyze how each query handles these edge cases. Ensure that data type differences do not affect the outcome. Verify that constraints (e.g., NOT NULL, UNIQUE) are accounted for.
5. Evaluate Aggregations and Calculations: Confirm that aggregate functions (e.g., SUM, COUNT) are applied identically. Ensure calculations (e.g., subtraction, addition) produce the same results.
6. Check for Logical Equivalence in Conditional Expressions: Compare conditional expressions like IIF, CASE WHEN, and IF. Determine if conditions and returned values are logically the same.
7. Assess Ordering of Results: If ORDER BY clause is present, confirm that both queries order results identically. Recognize that differing order may affect equivalence if result order is significant.
8. Generate a New Logical Equivalence Rule (If Applicable): Create an "Equivalent Queries: <query1>
<query2>
Schema Conditions:<conditions>" statement that defines the equivalence. Use GENERALIZED COLUMN and TABLE NAMES. Specify any necessary conditions based on the database schema. Present the rule clearly, indicating both the equivalence and the conditions under which it holds.



Example Equivalence Rules:

<Rule1>
Equivalent Queries:
SELECT CAST(SUM(column1) AS REAL) / COUNT(column2) FROM table1 INNER JOIN table2 ON table1.col1 = table2.col1 WHERE condition;
SELECT AVG(column1) FROM table1 INNER JOIN table2 ON table1.col1 = table2.col1 WHERE condition;
Schema Conditions:
None.
</Rule1>

<Rule2>
Equivalent Queries:
SELECT COUNT(table1.col1) FROM table1 INNER JOIN table2 ON table1.col1 = table2.col2 INNER JOIN table3 ON table2.col3 = table3.col4 WHERE table1.condition1 = 'value' AND table3.condition2 = 'value';
SELECT COUNT(table3.col4) FROM table3 INNER JOIN table2 ON table3.col4 = table2.col3 INNER JOIN table1 ON table2.col2 = table1.col1 WHERE table1.condition1 = 'value' AND table3.condition2 = 'value';
Schema Conditions:
table1.col1 is a primary key, table3.col4 is a primary key, and table2.col2 and table2.col3 are foreign keys referencing table1.col1 and table3.col4 respectively.
</Rule2>

<Rule3>
Equivalent Queries:
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM table1 INNER JOIN table2 ON table1.col1 = table2.col2 WHERE condition;
SELECT COUNT(table1.col1) FROM table2 INNER JOIN table1 ON table2.col2 = table1.col1 WHERE condition;
Schema Conditions:
table1.col1 is a non-nullable column that uniquely identifies rows in table1.
</Rule3>

<Rule4>
Equivalent Queries:
SELECT SUM(IIF(condition1, expr1, 0)) - SUM(IIF(condition2, expr2, 0)) FROM table;
SELECT SUM(CASE WHEN condition1 THEN expr1 ELSE 0 END) - SUM(CASE WHEN condition2 THEN expr2 ELSE 0 END) FROM table;
Schema Conditions:
None.
</Rule4>

<Rule5>
Equivalent Queries:
SELECT CAST(SUM(IIF(condition, 1, 0)) AS FLOAT) / SUM(IIF(condition, 1, 0)) FROM table;
SELECT CAST(SUM(CASE WHEN condition THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS REAL) / SUM(CASE WHEN condition THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) FROM table;
Schema Conditions:
None.
</Rule5>

<Rule6>
Equivalent Queries:
SELECT T1.col1, T2.col2 FROM table1 AS T1 INNER JOIN table2 AS T2 ON T1.col3 = T2.col3 WHERE T1.col3 = value;
SELECT table1.col1, table2.col2 FROM table1 INNER JOIN table2 ON table1.col3 = table2.col3 WHERE table1.col3 = value;
Schema Conditions:
table1.col3 is a primary key, and table2.col3 is a foreign key referencing table1.col3.
</Rule6>

<Rule7>
Equivalent Queries:
SELECT CAST(SUM(IIF(condition, 1, 0)) AS FLOAT) * 100 / COUNT(column) FROM table1 INNER JOIN table2 ON table1.col1 = table2.col1 WHERE table1.date_col = 'date_value';
SELECT CAST(SUM(CASE WHEN condition THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS REAL) * 100 / COUNT(column) FROM table2 INNER JOIN table1 ON table2.col1 = table1.col1 WHERE table1.date_col = 'date_value';
Schema Conditions:
table1.col1 is a foreign key referencing table2.col1, and table2.col1 is a primary key.
</Rule7>

<Rule8>
Equivalent Queries:
SELECT T2.col2 FROM table1 AS T1 INNER JOIN table2 AS T2 ON T1.col1 = T2.col1 WHERE T1.col3 = 'value1' AND T1.col4 = 'value2';
SELECT table2.col2 FROM table2 INNER JOIN table1 ON table2.col1 = table1.col1 WHERE table1.col3 = 'value1' AND table1.col4 = 'value2';
Schema Conditions:
table1.col1 is a foreign key referencing table2.col1, and table2.col1 is a primary key.
</Rule8>

<Rule9>
Equivalent Queries:
SELECT ... FROM table WHERE condition1 AND condition2;
SELECT ... FROM table WHERE condition2 AND condition1;
Schema Conditions:
None.
</Rule9>



# Guidelines:
- Make SURE complete to every step PERFECTLY without ANY Mistakes
- Follow the Rules I Gave you and Remember to AVOID generating repeated equivalence rules in the examples I gave you.
- Be sure to format your response like the example equivalence rules I gave you.
- Put <New Rule></New Rule> around the new equivalence rule that you think of. Do not use other formatting around the equivalent queries.
- Use GENERALIZED COLUMN AND TABLE NAMES in any EQUIVALENCE RULE YOU WRITE. DO NOT USE THE SAME NAMES IN THE PROVIDED QUERY PAIRS!!!!
- If the two queries are not logically equivalent, say <New Rule> Not equivalent </New Rule>.
- If the new equivalence rule is already repeated in the examples listed, say <New Rule> Rule exists </New Rule>.
- The new rule should be be MINIMAL to CLEARLY demonstrate the highlighted semantic difference. Use ellipses to shorten SQL queries where necessary to achieve this.

Take a Deep Breath and Carefully Follow the Rules, Guides and Examples I gave you. I will tip you $2000 if you do EVERYTHING Perfectly.

INFO:root:model: gpt-4o
INFO:root:prompt: You are an expert SQL engineer with 20+ years of experience. You will be given some SQL equivalence rules conditional on some database schemas. You will then be given a pair of SQL queries, consisting of a gold query and a machine-generated query, and a database schema that defines the context of the queries. 

Your task is to compare the two provided SQL queries on logical equivalence and generate one more equivalence rule in the same format as the provided example equivalence rules.

Please make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please also keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.



Evaluation Criteria:

Logical equivalence - the alignment between the gold SQL query and the machine-generated SQL query. A machine-generated SQL query is logically equivalent to the gold query if these two queries would RETURN THE SAME RESULTS AND IN THE SAME ORDER for ALL POSSIBLE DATABASE INSTANCES that satisfy the provided database schema for these queries. Annotators were asked to penalize machine-generated queries that overlooked edge cases that the gold queries would have caught otherwise.



Evaluation steps:

1. Understand the Database Schema: Identify all tables used in both queries. List all columns referenced, along with their data types and constraints. Determine primary and foreign key relationships. Note any indexes or unique constraints that may affect query execution.
2. Parse and Break Down Each Query: Identify selected columns, functions, and expressions. Note the tables involved and the join conditions. Understand the filtering conditions applied. Identify grouping and aggregate conditions, if any. Determine if result ordering affects equivalence.
3. Compare Query Components: Check if both queries use the same tables and join conditions. Compare filtering conditions in the WHERE clauses. Assess whether the same columns and expressions are selected. Identify if different functions or syntaxes achieve the same result. Look for logical equivalence in expressions and calculations.
4. Consider Edge Cases and Data Variations: Conceptualize sample datasets that include edge cases (e.g., NULL values, zero values, special characters). Analyze how each query handles these edge cases. Ensure that data type differences do not affect the outcome. Verify that constraints (e.g., NOT NULL, UNIQUE) are accounted for.
5. Evaluate Aggregations and Calculations: Confirm that aggregate functions (e.g., SUM, COUNT) are applied identically. Ensure calculations (e.g., subtraction, addition) produce the same results.
6. Check for Logical Equivalence in Conditional Expressions: Compare conditional expressions like IIF, CASE WHEN, and IF. Determine if conditions and returned values are logically the same.
7. Assess Ordering of Results: If ORDER BY clause is present, confirm that both queries order results identically. Recognize that differing order may affect equivalence if result order is significant.
8. Generate a New Logical Equivalence Rule (If Applicable): Create an "Equivalent Queries: <query1>
<query2>
Schema Conditions:<conditions>" statement that defines the equivalence. Use GENERALIZED COLUMN and TABLE NAMES. Specify any necessary conditions based on the database schema. Present the rule clearly, indicating both the equivalence and the conditions under which it holds.



Example Equivalence Rules:

<Rule1>
Equivalent Queries:
SELECT CAST(SUM(IIF(condition, 1, 0)) AS FLOAT) * 100 / COUNT(column) FROM table1 INNER JOIN table2 ON table1.col1 = table2.col1 WHERE table1.date_col = 'date_value';
SELECT CAST(SUM(CASE WHEN condition THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS REAL) * 100 / COUNT(column) FROM table2 INNER JOIN table1 ON table2.col1 = table1.col1 WHERE table1.date_col = 'date_value';
Schema Conditions:
table1.col1 is a foreign key referencing table2.col1, and table2.col1 is a primary key.
</Rule1>

<Rule2>
Equivalent Queries:
SELECT T1.col1, T2.col2 FROM table1 AS T1 INNER JOIN table2 AS T2 ON T1.col3 = T2.col3 WHERE T1.col3 = value;
SELECT table1.col1, table2.col2 FROM table1 INNER JOIN table2 ON table1.col3 = table2.col3 WHERE table1.col3 = value;
Schema Conditions:
table1.col3 is a primary key, and table2.col3 is a foreign key referencing table1.col3.
</Rule2>

<Rule3>
Equivalent Queries:
SELECT ... FROM table WHERE condition1 AND condition2;
SELECT ... FROM table WHERE condition2 AND condition1;
Schema Conditions:
None.
</Rule3>

<Rule4>
Equivalent Queries:
SELECT CAST(SUM(IIF(condition, 1, 0)) AS FLOAT) / SUM(IIF(condition, 1, 0)) FROM table;
SELECT CAST(SUM(CASE WHEN condition THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS REAL) / SUM(CASE WHEN condition THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) FROM table;
Schema Conditions:
None.
</Rule4>

<Rule5>
Equivalent Queries:
SELECT T2.col2 FROM table1 AS T1 INNER JOIN table2 AS T2 ON T1.col1 = T2.col1 WHERE T1.col3 = 'value1' AND T1.col4 = 'value2';
SELECT table2.col2 FROM table2 INNER JOIN table1 ON table2.col1 = table1.col1 WHERE table1.col3 = 'value1' AND table1.col4 = 'value2';
Schema Conditions:
table1.col1 is a foreign key referencing table2.col1, and table2.col1 is a primary key.
</Rule5>

<Rule6>
Equivalent Queries:
SELECT SUM(IIF(condition1, expr1, 0)) - SUM(IIF(condition2, expr2, 0)) FROM table;
SELECT SUM(CASE WHEN condition1 THEN expr1 ELSE 0 END) - SUM(CASE WHEN condition2 THEN expr2 ELSE 0 END) FROM table;
Schema Conditions:
None.
</Rule6>

<Rule7>
Equivalent Queries:
SELECT COUNT(table1.col1) FROM table1 INNER JOIN table2 ON table1.col1 = table2.col2 INNER JOIN table3 ON table2.col3 = table3.col4 WHERE table1.condition1 = 'value' AND table3.condition2 = 'value';
SELECT COUNT(table3.col4) FROM table3 INNER JOIN table2 ON table3.col4 = table2.col3 INNER JOIN table1 ON table2.col2 = table1.col1 WHERE table1.condition1 = 'value' AND table3.condition2 = 'value';
Schema Conditions:
table1.col1 is a primary key, table3.col4 is a primary key, and table2.col2 and table2.col3 are foreign keys referencing table1.col1 and table3.col4 respectively.
</Rule7>

<Rule8>
Equivalent Queries:
SELECT CAST(SUM(column1) AS REAL) / COUNT(column2) FROM table1 INNER JOIN table2 ON table1.col1 = table2.col1 WHERE condition;
SELECT AVG(column1) FROM table1 INNER JOIN table2 ON table1.col1 = table2.col1 WHERE condition;
Schema Conditions:
None.
</Rule8>

<Rule9>
Equivalent Queries:
SELECT column_name FROM table_name WHERE SUBSTR(date_column, 1, 7) = 'YYYY-MM';
SELECT column_name FROM table_name WHERE date_column LIKE 'YYYY-MM%';
Schema Conditions:
None.
</Rule9>

<Rule10>
Equivalent Queries:
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM table1 INNER JOIN table2 ON table1.col1 = table2.col2 WHERE condition;
SELECT COUNT(table1.col1) FROM table2 INNER JOIN table1 ON table2.col2 = table1.col1 WHERE condition;
Schema Conditions:
table1.col1 is a non-nullable column that uniquely identifies rows in table1.
</Rule10>



# Guidelines:
- Make SURE complete to every step PERFECTLY without ANY Mistakes
- Follow the Rules I Gave you and Remember to AVOID generating repeated equivalence rules in the examples I gave you.
- Be sure to format your response like the example equivalence rules I gave you.
- Put <New Rule></New Rule> around the new equivalence rule that you think of. Do not use other formatting around the equivalent queries.
- Use GENERALIZED COLUMN AND TABLE NAMES in any EQUIVALENCE RULE YOU WRITE. DO NOT USE THE SAME NAMES IN THE PROVIDED QUERY PAIRS!!!!
- If the two queries are not logically equivalent, say <New Rule> Not equivalent </New Rule>.
- If the new equivalence rule is already repeated in the examples listed, say <New Rule> Rule exists </New Rule>.
- The new rule should be be MINIMAL to CLEARLY demonstrate the highlighted semantic difference. Use ellipses to shorten SQL queries where necessary to achieve this.

Take a Deep Breath and Carefully Follow the Rules, Guides and Examples I gave you. I will tip you $2000 if you do EVERYTHING Perfectly.



Pair of SQL Queries:
<Gold SQL Query>
SELECT t2.overall_rating FROM Player AS t1 INNER JOIN Player_Attributes AS t2 ON t1.player_api_id = t2.player_api_id WHERE t1.player_name = 'Gabriel Tamas' AND strftime('%Y', t2.date) = '2011';

Therefore, we can generate a new equivalence rule:\n\n<New Rule>\nEquivalent Queries:\nSELECT ...

INFO:root:model: gpt-4o
INFO:root:prompt: You are an expert SQL engineer with 20+ years of experience. You will be given some SQL equivalence rules conditional on some database schemas. You will then be given a pair of SQL queries, consisting of a gold query and a machine-generated query, and a database schema that defines the context of the queries. 

Your task is to compare the two provided SQL queries on logical equivalence and generate one more equivalence rule in the same format as the provided example equivalence rules.

Please make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please also keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.



Evaluation Criteria:

Logical equivalence - the alignment between the gold SQL query and the machine-generated SQL query. A machine-generated SQL query is logically equivalent to the gold query if these two queries would RETURN THE SAME RESULTS AND IN THE SAME ORDER for ALL POSSIBLE DATABASE INSTANCES that satisfy the provided database schema for these queries. Annotators were asked to penalize machine-generated queries that overlooked edge cases that the gold queries would have caught otherwise.



Evaluation steps:

1. Understand the Database Schema: Identify all tables used in both queries. List all columns referenced, along with their data types and constraints. Determine primary and foreign key relationships. Note any indexes or unique constraints that may affect query execution.
2. Parse and Break Down Each Query: Identify selected columns, functions, and expressions. Note the tables involved and the join conditions. Understand the filtering conditions applied. Identify grouping and aggregate conditions, if any. Determine if result ordering affects equivalence.
3. Compare Query Components: Check if both queries use the same tables and join conditions. Compare filtering conditions in the WHERE clauses. Assess whether the same columns and expressions are selected. Identify if different functions or syntaxes achieve the same result. Look for logical equivalence in expressions and calculations.
4. Consider Edge Cases and Data Variations: Conceptualize sample datasets that include edge cases (e.g., NULL values, zero values, special characters). Analyze how each query handles these edge cases. Ensure that data type differences do not affect the outcome. Verify that constraints (e.g., NOT NULL, UNIQUE) are accounted for.
5. Evaluate Aggregations and Calculations: Confirm that aggregate functions (e.g., SUM, COUNT) are applied identically. Ensure calculations (e.g., subtraction, addition) produce the same results.
6. Check for Logical Equivalence in Conditional Expressions: Compare conditional expressions like IIF, CASE WHEN, and IF. Determine if conditions and returned values are logically the same.
7. Assess Ordering of Results: If ORDER BY clause is present, confirm that both queries order results identically. Recognize that differing order may affect equivalence if result order is significant.
8. Generate a New Logical Equivalence Rule (If Applicable): Create an "Equivalent Queries: <query1>
<query2>
Schema Conditions:<conditions>" statement that defines the equivalence. Use GENERALIZED COLUMN and TABLE NAMES. Specify any necessary conditions based on the database schema. Present the rule clearly, indicating both the equivalence and the conditions under which it holds.



Example Equivalence Rules:

<Rule1>
Equivalent Queries:
SELECT ... FROM table1 INNER JOIN table2 ON table1.col1 = table2.col1 WHERE table1.col2 = 'value' AND strftime('%Y', table2.date_col) = 'YYYY';
SELECT ... FROM table1 INNER JOIN table2 ON table1.col1 = table2.col1 WHERE table1.col2 = 'value' AND table2.date_col LIKE 'YYYY%';
Schema Conditions:
table2.date_col is consistently formatted as 'YYYY-MM-DD'.
</Rule1>

<Rule2>
Equivalent Queries:
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM table1 INNER JOIN table2 ON table1.col1 = table2.col2 WHERE condition;
SELECT COUNT(table1.col1) FROM table2 INNER JOIN table1 ON table2.col2 = table1.col1 WHERE condition;
Schema Conditions:
table1.col1 is a non-nullable column that uniquely identifies rows in table1.
</Rule2>

<Rule3>
Equivalent Queries:
SELECT ... FROM table WHERE condition1 AND condition2;
SELECT ... FROM table WHERE condition2 AND condition1;
Schema Conditions:
None.
</Rule3>

<Rule4>
Equivalent Queries:
SELECT CAST(SUM(IIF(condition, 1, 0)) AS FLOAT) * 100 / COUNT(column) FROM table1 INNER JOIN table2 ON table1.col1 = table2.col1 WHERE table1.date_col = 'date_value';
SELECT CAST(SUM(CASE WHEN condition THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS REAL) * 100 / COUNT(column) FROM table2 INNER JOIN table1 ON table2.col1 = table1.col1 WHERE table1.date_col = 'date_value';
Schema Conditions:
table1.col1 is a foreign key referencing table2.col1, and table2.col1 is a primary key.
</Rule4>

<Rule5>
Equivalent Queries:
SELECT CAST(SUM(IIF(condition, 1, 0)) AS FLOAT) / SUM(IIF(condition, 1, 0)) FROM table;
SELECT CAST(SUM(CASE WHEN condition THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS REAL) / SUM(CASE WHEN condition THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) FROM table;
Schema Conditions:
None.
</Rule5>

<Rule6>
Equivalent Queries:
SELECT T2.col2 FROM table1 AS T1 INNER JOIN table2 AS T2 ON T1.col1 = T2.col1 WHERE T1.col3 = 'value1' AND T1.col4 = 'value2';
SELECT table2.col2 FROM table2 INNER JOIN table1 ON table2.col1 = table1.col1 WHERE table1.col3 = 'value1' AND table1.col4 = 'value2';
Schema Conditions:
table1.col1 is a foreign key referencing table2.col1, and table2.col1 is a primary key.
</Rule6>

<Rule7>
Equivalent Queries:
SELECT CAST(SUM(column1) AS REAL) / COUNT(column2) FROM table1 INNER JOIN table2 ON table1.col1 = table2.col1 WHERE condition;
SELECT AVG(column1) FROM table1 INNER JOIN table2 ON table1.col1 = table2.col1 WHERE condition;
Schema Conditions:
None.
</Rule7>

<Rule8>
Equivalent Queries:
SELECT T1.col1, T2.col2 FROM table1 AS T1 INNER JOIN table2 AS T2 ON T1.col3 = T2.col3 WHERE T1.col3 = value;
SELECT table1.col1, table2.col2 FROM table1 INNER JOIN table2 ON table1.col3 = table2.col3 WHERE table1.col3 = value;
Schema Conditions:
table1.col3 is a primary key, and table2.col3 is a foreign key referencing table1.col3.
</Rule8>

<Rule9>
Equivalent Queries:
SELECT COUNT(table1.col1) FROM table1 INNER JOIN table2 ON table1.col1 = table2.col2 INNER JOIN table3 ON table2.col3 = table3.col4 WHERE table1.condition1 = 'value' AND table3.condition2 = 'value';
SELECT COUNT(table3.col4) FROM table3 INNER JOIN table2 ON table3.col4 = table2.col3 INNER JOIN table1 ON table2.col2 = table1.col1 WHERE table1.condition1 = 'value' AND table3.condition2 = 'value';
Schema Conditions:
table1.col1 is a primary key, table3.col4 is a primary key, and table2.col2 and table2.col3 are foreign keys referencing table1.col1 and table3.col4 respectively.
</Rule9>

<Rule10>
Equivalent Queries:
SELECT column_name FROM table_name WHERE SUBSTR(date_column, 1, 7) = 'YYYY-MM';
SELECT column_name FROM table_name WHERE date_column LIKE 'YYYY-MM%';
Schema Conditions:
None.
</Rule10>

<Rule11>
Equivalent Queries:
SELECT SUM(IIF(condition1, expr1, 0)) - SUM(IIF(condition2, expr2, 0)) FROM table;
SELECT SUM(CASE WHEN condition1 THEN expr1 ELSE 0 END) - SUM(CASE WHEN condition2 THEN expr2 ELSE 0 END) FROM table;
Schema Conditions:
None.
</Rule11>



# Guidelines:
- Make SURE complete to every step PERFECTLY without ANY Mistakes
- Follow the Rules I Gave you and Remember to AVOID generating repeated equivalence rules in the examples I gave you.
- Be sure to format your response like the example equivalence rules I gave you.
- Put <New Rule></New Rule> around the new equivalence rule that you think of. Do not use other formatting around the equivalent queries.
- Use GENERALIZED COLUMN AND TABLE NAMES in any EQUIVALENCE RULE YOU WRITE. DO NOT USE THE SAME NAMES IN THE PROVIDED QUERY PAIRS!!!!
- If the two queries are not logically equivalent, say <New Rule> Not equivalent </New Rule>.
- If the new equivalence rule is already repeated in the examples listed, say <New Rule> Rule exists </New Rule>.
- The new rule should be be MINIMAL to CLEARLY demonstrate the highlighted semantic difference. Use ellipses to shorten SQL queries where necessary to achieve this.

Take a Deep Breath and Carefully Follow the Rules, Guides and Examples I gave you. I will tip you $2000 if you do EVERYTHING Perfectly.

The AVG function in the machine-generated query inherently handles NULLs by ignoring them, similar to the division in the gold query.\n\n### Step 5: Evaluate Aggregations and Calculations\n\nThe gold query calculates the average by dividing the sum of goals by the count of match records, which is equivalent to the `AVG` function used in the machine-generated query.\n\n### Step 6: Check for Logical Equivalence in Conditional Expressions\n\nThe conditional expressions in both queries are logically equivalent.\n\n### Step 7: Assess Ordering of Results\n\nThere is no `ORDER BY` clause in either query, so ordering does not affect equivalence.\n\n### Step 8: Generate a New Logical Equivalence Rule\n\nThe queries are logically equivalent, and this scenario is not covered by the existing rules. Therefore, I will generate a new equivalence rule.\n\n<New Rule>\nEquivalent Queries:\nSELECT CAST(SUM(column1) AS REAL) / COUNT(column2) FROM table1 INNER JOIN table2 ON table1.col1 = table2.col1 WHERE condition;\nSELECT AVG(column1) FROM table2 INNER JOIN table1 ON table2.col1 = table1.col1 WHERE condition;\nSchema Conditions:\nNone.\n", role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None, refusal=None))], created=1730776395, model='gpt-4o-2024-08-06', object='chat.completion', system_fingerprint='fp_45cf54deae', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=857, prompt_tokens=4059, total_tokens=4916, prompt_tokens_details={'cached_tokens': 0}, completion_tokens_details={'reasoning_tokens': 0, 'accepted_prediction_tokens': 0, 'rejected_prediction_tokens': 0}))

INFO:root:model: gpt-4o
INFO:root:prompt: You are an expert SQL engineer with 20+ years of experience. You will be given some SQL equivalence rules conditional on some database schemas. You will then be given a pair of SQL queries, consisting of a gold query and a machine-generated query, and a database schema that defines the context of the queries. 

Your task is to compare the two provided SQL queries on logical equivalence and generate one more equivalence rule in the same format as the provided example equivalence rules.

Please make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please also keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.



Evaluation Criteria:

Logical equivalence - the alignment between the gold SQL query and the machine-generated SQL query. A machine-generated SQL query is logically equivalent to the gold query if these two queries would RETURN THE SAME RESULTS AND IN THE SAME ORDER for ALL POSSIBLE DATABASE INSTANCES that satisfy the provided database schema for these queries. Annotators were asked to penalize machine-generated queries that overlooked edge cases that the gold queries would have caught otherwise.



Evaluation steps:

1. Understand the Database Schema: Identify all tables used in both queries. List all columns referenced, along with their data types and constraints. Determine primary and foreign key relationships. Note any indexes or unique constraints that may affect query execution.
2. Parse and Break Down Each Query: Identify selected columns, functions, and expressions. Note the tables involved and the join conditions. Understand the filtering conditions applied. Identify grouping and aggregate conditions, if any. Determine if result ordering affects equivalence.
3. Compare Query Components: Check if both queries use the same tables and join conditions. Compare filtering conditions in the WHERE clauses. Assess whether the same columns and expressions are selected. Identify if different functions or syntaxes achieve the same result. Look for logical equivalence in expressions and calculations.
4. Consider Edge Cases and Data Variations: Conceptualize sample datasets that include edge cases (e.g., NULL values, zero values, special characters). Analyze how each query handles these edge cases. Ensure that data type differences do not affect the outcome. Verify that constraints (e.g., NOT NULL, UNIQUE) are accounted for.
5. Evaluate Aggregations and Calculations: Confirm that aggregate functions (e.g., SUM, COUNT) are applied identically. Ensure calculations (e.g., subtraction, addition) produce the same results.
6. Check for Logical Equivalence in Conditional Expressions: Compare conditional expressions like IIF, CASE WHEN, and IF. Determine if conditions and returned values are logically the same.
7. Assess Ordering of Results: If ORDER BY clause is present, confirm that both queries order results identically. Recognize that differing order may affect equivalence if result order is significant.
8. Generate a New Logical Equivalence Rule (If Applicable): Create an "Equivalent Queries: <query1>
<query2>
Schema Conditions:<conditions>" statement that defines the equivalence. Use GENERALIZED COLUMN and TABLE NAMES. Specify any necessary conditions based on the database schema. Present the rule clearly, indicating both the equivalence and the conditions under which it holds.



Example Equivalence Rules:

<Rule1>
Equivalent Queries:
SELECT column_name FROM table_name WHERE SUBSTR(date_column, 1, 7) = 'YYYY-MM';
SELECT column_name FROM table_name WHERE date_column LIKE 'YYYY-MM%';
Schema Conditions:

SELECT table1.col1, table2.col2 FROM table1 INNER JOIN table2 ON table1.col3 = table2.col3 WHERE table1.col3 = value;
Schema Conditions:
table1.col3 is a primary key, and table2.col3 is a foreign key referencing table1.col3.
</Rule2>

<Rule3>
Equivalent Queries:
SELECT CAST(SUM(IIF(condition, 1, 0)) AS FLOAT) / SUM(IIF(condition, 1, 0)) FROM table;
SELECT CAST(SUM(CASE WHEN condition THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS REAL) / SUM(CASE WHEN condition THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) FROM table;

SELECT COUNT(table3.col4) FROM table3 INNER JOIN table2 ON table3.col4 = table2.col3 INNER JOIN table1 ON table2.col2 = table1.col1 WHERE table1.condition1 = 'value' AND table3.condition2 = 'value';
Schema Conditions:
table1.col1 is a primary key, table3.col4 is a primary key, and table2.col2 and table2.col3 are foreign keys referencing table1.col1 and table3.col4 respectively.
</Rule4>

<Rule5>
Equivalent Queries:
SELECT CAST(SUM(IIF(condition, 1, 0)) AS FLOAT) * 100 / COUNT(column) FROM table1 INNER JOIN table2 ON table1.col1 = table2.col1 WHERE table1.date_col = 'date_value';
SELECT CAST(SUM(CASE WHEN condition THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS REAL) * 100 / COUNT(column) FROM table2 INNER JOIN table1 ON table2.col1 = table1.col1 WHERE table1.date_col = 'date_value';
Schema Conditions:

</Rule5>

<Rule6>
Equivalent Queries:

SELECT table2.col2 FROM table2 INNER JOIN table1 ON table2.col1 = table1.col1 WHERE table1.col3 = 'value1' AND table1.col4 = 'value2';
Schema Conditions:
table1.col1 is a foreign key referencing table2.col1, and table2.col1 is a primary key.
</Rule7>

<Rule8>
Equivalent Queries:
SELECT SUM(IIF(condition1, expr1, 0)) - SUM(IIF(condition2, expr2, 0)) FROM table;
SELECT SUM(CASE WHEN condition1 THEN expr1 ELSE 0 END) - SUM(CASE WHEN condition2 THEN expr2 ELSE 0 END) FROM table;
Schema Conditions:
None.
</Rule8>

<Rule9>
Equivalent Queries:
SELECT CAST(SUM(column1) AS REAL) / COUNT(column2) FROM table1 INNER JOIN table2 ON table1.col1 = table2.col1 WHERE condition;
SELECT AVG(column1) FROM table1 INNER JOIN table2 ON table1.col1 = table2.col1 WHERE condition;
Schema Conditions:
None.
</Rule9>

<Rule10>
Equivalent Queries:
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM table1 INNER JOIN table2 ON table1.col1 = table2.col2 WHERE condition;
SELECT COUNT(table1.col1) FROM table2 INNER JOIN table1 ON table2.col2 = table1.col1 WHERE condition;
Schema Conditions:
table1.col1 is a non-nullable column that uniquely identifies rows in table1.
</Rule10>

<Rule11>
Equivalent Queries:
SELECT ... FROM table1 INNER JOIN table2 ON table1.col1 = table2.col1 WHERE table1.col2 = 'value' AND strftime('%Y', table2.date_col) = 'YYYY';
SELECT ... FROM table1 INNER JOIN table2 ON table1.col1 = table2.col1 WHERE table1.col2 = 'value' AND table2.date_col LIKE 'YYYY%';
Schema Conditions:
table2.date_col is consistently formatted as 'YYYY-MM-DD'.
</Rule11>



# Guidelines:
- Make SURE complete to every step PERFECTLY without ANY Mistakes
- Follow the Rules I Gave you and Remember to AVOID generating repeated equivalence rules in the examples I gave you.
- Be sure to format your response like the example equivalence rules I gave you.
- Put <New Rule></New Rule> around the new equivalence rule that you think of. Do not use other formatting around the equivalent queries.
- Use GENERALIZED COLUMN AND TABLE NAMES in any EQUIVALENCE RULE YOU WRITE. DO NOT USE THE SAME NAMES IN THE PROVIDED QUERY PAIRS!!!!
- If the two queries are not logically equivalent, say <New Rule> Not equivalent </New Rule>.
- If the new equivalence rule is already repeated in the examples listed, say <New Rule> Rule exists </New Rule>.
- The new rule should be be MINIMAL to CLEARLY demonstrate the highlighted semantic difference. Use ellipses to shorten SQL queries where necessary to achieve this.

Take a Deep Breath and Carefully Follow the Rules, Guides and Examples I gave you. I will tip you $2000 if you do EVERYTHING Perfectly.

In SQLite, which is often case-insensitive, these queries would typically be equivalent.\n\n### Step 5: Evaluate Aggregations and Calculations\n\n- Not applicable here as there are no aggregations or calculations.\n\n### Step 6: Check for Logical Equivalence in Conditional Expressions\n\n- Not applicable here as there are no conditional expressions.\n\n### Step 7: Assess Ordering of Results\n\n- Both queries order the results in the same manner (`height DESC`), ensuring the same result order.\n\n### Step 8: Generate a New Logical Equivalence Rule (If Applicable)\n\nGiven the context of the schema and the typical case insensitivity of table names in SQLite, these queries are equivalent. However, the equivalence is conditional on the database's case sensitivity settings. Since this rule might already exist due to the common nature of case insensitivity in SQL, let's check:\n\n- The given rules do not explicitly cover case sensitivity of table names.\n\nTherefore, we can create a new rule:\n\n<New Rule>\nEquivalent Queries:\nSELECT column_name FROM Table ORDER BY column2 DESC LIMIT 1;\nSELECT column_name FROM table ORDER BY column2 DESC LIMIT 1;\nSchema Conditions:\nThe database is configured to be case-insensitive for table names.\n", role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None, refusal=None))], created=1730776413, model='gpt-4o-2024-08-06', object='chat.completion', system_fingerprint='fp_45cf54deae', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=591, prompt_tokens=3985, total_tokens=4576, prompt_tokens_details={'cached_tokens': 0}, completion_tokens_details={'reasoning_tokens': 0, 'accepted_prediction_tokens': 0, 'rejected_prediction_tokens': 0}))

INFO:root:prompt: You are an expert SQL engineer with 20+ years of experience. You will be given some SQL equivalence rules conditional on some database schemas. You will then be given a pair of SQL queries, consisting of a gold query and a machine-generated query, and a database schema that defines the context of the queries. 

Your task is to compare the two provided SQL queries on logical equivalence and generate one more equivalence rule in the same format as the provided example equivalence rules.

Logical equivalence - the alignment between the gold SQL query and the machine-generated SQL query. A machine-generated SQL query is logically equivalent to the gold query if these two queries would RETURN THE SAME RESULTS AND IN THE SAME ORDER for ALL POSSIBLE DATABASE INSTANCES that satisfy the provided database schema for these queries. Annotators were asked to penalize machine-generated queries that overlooked edge cases that the gold queries would have caught otherwise.



Evaluation steps:

1. Understand the Database Schema: Identify all tables used in both queries. List all columns referenced, along with their data types and constraints. Determine primary and foreign key relationships. Note any indexes or unique constraints that may affect query execution.
2. Parse and Break Down Each Query: Identify selected columns, functions, and expressions. Note the tables involved and the join conditions. Understand the filtering conditions applied. Identify grouping and aggregate conditions, if any. Determine if result ordering affects equivalence.
3. Compare Query Components: Check if both queries use the same tables and join conditions. Compare filtering conditions in the WHERE clauses. Assess whether the same columns and expressions are selected. Identify if different functions or syntaxes achieve the same result. Look for logical equivalence in expressions and calculations.
4. Consider Edge Cases and Data Variations: Conceptualize sample datasets that include edge cases (e.g., NULL values, zero values, special characters). Analyze how each query handles these edge cases. Ensure that data type differences do not affect the outcome. Verify that constraints (e.g., NOT NULL, UNIQUE) are accounted for.
5. Evaluate Aggregations and Calculations: Confirm that aggregate functions (e.g., SUM, COUNT) are applied identically. Ensure calculations (e.g., subtraction, addition) produce the same results.
6. Check for Logical Equivalence in Conditional Expressions: Compare conditional expressions like IIF, CASE WHEN, and IF. Determine if conditions and returned values are logically the same.
7. Assess Ordering of Results: If ORDER BY clause is present, confirm that both queries order results identically. Recognize that differing order may affect equivalence if result order is significant.
8. Generate a New Logical Equivalence Rule (If Applicable): Create an "Equivalent Queries: <query1>
<query2>
Schema Conditions:<conditions>" statement that defines the equivalence. Use GENERALIZED COLUMN and TABLE NAMES. Specify any necessary conditions based on the database schema. Present the rule clearly, indicating both the equivalence and the conditions under which it holds.



Example Equivalence Rules:

<Rule1>
Equivalent Queries:
SELECT ... FROM table1 INNER JOIN table2 ON table1.col1 = table2.col1 WHERE table1.col2 = 'value' AND strftime('%Y', table2.date_col) = 'YYYY';
SELECT ... FROM table1 INNER JOIN table2 ON table1.col1 = table2.col1 WHERE table1.col2 = 'value' AND table2.date_col LIKE 'YYYY%';
Schema Conditions:
table2.date_col is consistently formatted as 'YYYY-MM-DD'.
</Rule1>

<Rule2>
Equivalent Queries:
SELECT SUM(IIF(condition1, expr1, 0)) - SUM(IIF(condition2, expr2, 0)) FROM table;
SELECT SUM(CASE WHEN condition1 THEN expr1 ELSE 0 END) - SUM(CASE WHEN condition2 THEN expr2 ELSE 0 END) FROM table;
Schema Conditions:
None.
</Rule2>

<Rule3>
Equivalent Queries:
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM table1 INNER JOIN table2 ON table1.col1 = table2.col2 WHERE condition;
SELECT COUNT(table1.col1) FROM table2 INNER JOIN table1 ON table2.col2 = table1.col1 WHERE condition;
Schema Conditions:
table1.col1 is a non-nullable column that uniquely identifies rows in table1.
</Rule3>

<Rule4>
Equivalent Queries:
SELECT CAST(SUM(IIF(condition, 1, 0)) AS FLOAT) / SUM(IIF(condition, 1, 0)) FROM table;
SELECT CAST(SUM(CASE WHEN condition THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS REAL) / SUM(CASE WHEN condition THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) FROM table;
Schema Conditions:
None.
</Rule4>

<Rule5>
Equivalent Queries:
SELECT CAST(SUM(IIF(condition, 1, 0)) AS FLOAT) * 100 / COUNT(column) FROM table1 INNER JOIN table2 ON table1.col1 = table2.col1 WHERE table1.date_col = 'date_value';
SELECT CAST(SUM(CASE WHEN condition THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS REAL) * 100 / COUNT(column) FROM table2 INNER JOIN table1 ON table2.col1 = table1.col1 WHERE table1.date_col = 'date_value';
Schema Conditions:
table1.col1 is a foreign key referencing table2.col1, and table2.col1 is a primary key.
</Rule5>

<Rule6>
Equivalent Queries:
SELECT column_name FROM table_name WHERE SUBSTR(date_column, 1, 7) = 'YYYY-MM';
SELECT column_name FROM table_name WHERE date_column LIKE 'YYYY-MM%';
Schema Conditions:
None.
</Rule6>

<Rule7>
Equivalent Queries:
SELECT ... FROM table WHERE condition1 AND condition2;
SELECT ... FROM table WHERE condition2 AND condition1;
Schema Conditions:
None.
</Rule7>

<Rule8>
Equivalent Queries:
SELECT T2.col2 FROM table1 AS T1 INNER JOIN table2 AS T2 ON T1.col1 = T2.col1 WHERE T1.col3 = 'value1' AND T1.col4 = 'value2';

SELECT AVG(column1) FROM table1 INNER JOIN table2 ON table1.col1 = table2.col1 WHERE condition;
Schema Conditions:
None.
</Rule9>

<Rule10>

# Guidelines:
- Make SURE complete to every step PERFECTLY without ANY Mistakes
- Follow the Rules I Gave you and Remember to AVOID generating repeated equivalence rules in the examples I gave you.
- Be sure to format your response like the example equivalence rules I gave you.
- Put <New Rule></New Rule> around the new equivalence rule that you think of. Do not use other formatting around the equivalent queries.
- Use GENERALIZED COLUMN AND TABLE NAMES in any EQUIVALENCE RULE YOU WRITE. DO NOT USE THE SAME NAMES IN THE PROVIDED QUERY PAIRS!!!!
- If the two queries are not logically equivalent, say <New Rule> Not equivalent </New Rule>.
- If the new equivalence rule is already repeated in the examples listed, say <New Rule> Rule exists </New Rule>.
- The new rule should be be MINIMAL to CLEARLY demonstrate the highlighted semantic difference. Use ellipses to shorten SQL queries where necessary to achieve this.

Take a Deep Breath and Carefully Follow the Rules, Guides and Examples I gave you. I will tip you $2000 if you do EVERYTHING Perfectly.

INFO:root:model: gpt-4o
INFO:root:prompt: You are an expert SQL engineer with 20+ years of experience. You will be given some SQL equivalence rules conditional on some database schemas. You will then be given a pair of SQL queries, consisting of a gold query and a machine-generated query, and a database schema that defines the context of the queries. 

Your task is to compare the two provided SQL queries on logical equivalence and generate one more equivalence rule in the same format as the provided example equivalence rules.

Please make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please also keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.



Evaluation Criteria:

Logical equivalence - the alignment between the gold SQL query and the machine-generated SQL query. A machine-generated SQL query is logically equivalent to the gold query if these two queries would RETURN THE SAME RESULTS AND IN THE SAME ORDER for ALL POSSIBLE DATABASE INSTANCES that satisfy the provided database schema for these queries. Annotators were asked to penalize machine-generated queries that overlooked edge cases that the gold queries would have caught otherwise.



Evaluation steps:

1. Understand the Database Schema: Identify all tables used in both queries. List all columns referenced, along with their data types and constraints. Determine primary and foreign key relationships. Note any indexes or unique constraints that may affect query execution.
2. Parse and Break Down Each Query: Identify selected columns, functions, and expressions. Note the tables involved and the join conditions. Understand the filtering conditions applied. Identify grouping and aggregate conditions, if any. Determine if result ordering affects equivalence.
3. Compare Query Components: Check if both queries use the same tables and join conditions. Compare filtering conditions in the WHERE clauses. Assess whether the same columns and expressions are selected. Identify if different functions or syntaxes achieve the same result. Look for logical equivalence in expressions and calculations.
4. Consider Edge Cases and Data Variations: Conceptualize sample datasets that include edge cases (e.g., NULL values, zero values, special characters). Analyze how each query handles these edge cases. Ensure that data type differences do not affect the outcome. Verify that constraints (e.g., NOT NULL, UNIQUE) are accounted for.
5. Evaluate Aggregations and Calculations: Confirm that aggregate functions (e.g., SUM, COUNT) are applied identically. Ensure calculations (e.g., subtraction, addition) produce the same results.
6. Check for Logical Equivalence in Conditional Expressions: Compare conditional expressions like IIF, CASE WHEN, and IF. Determine if conditions and returned values are logically the same.
7. Assess Ordering of Results: If ORDER BY clause is present, confirm that both queries order results identically. Recognize that differing order may affect equivalence if result order is significant.
8. Generate a New Logical Equivalence Rule (If Applicable): Create an "Equivalent Queries: <query1>
<query2>
Schema Conditions:<conditions>" statement that defines the equivalence. Use GENERALIZED COLUMN and TABLE NAMES. Specify any necessary conditions based on the database schema. Present the rule clearly, indicating both the equivalence and the conditions under which it holds.



Example Equivalence Rules:

<Rule1>
Equivalent Queries:
SELECT column_name FROM table_name WHERE SUBSTR(date_column, 1, 7) = 'YYYY-MM';
SELECT column_name FROM table_name WHERE date_column LIKE 'YYYY-MM%';
Schema Conditions:
None.
</Rule1>

<Rule2>
Equivalent Queries:
SELECT ... FROM table WHERE condition1 AND condition2;
SELECT ... FROM table WHERE condition2 AND condition1;
Schema Conditions:
None.
</Rule2>

<Rule3>
Equivalent Queries:
SELECT CAST(SUM(IIF(condition, 1, 0)) AS FLOAT) * 100 / COUNT(column) FROM table1 INNER JOIN table2 ON table1.col1 = table2.col1 WHERE table1.date_col = 'date_value';
SELECT CAST(SUM(CASE WHEN condition THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS REAL) * 100 / COUNT(column) FROM table2 INNER JOIN table1 ON table2.col1 = table1.col1 WHERE table1.date_col = 'date_value';
Schema Conditions:
table1.col1 is a foreign key referencing table2.col1, and table2.col1 is a primary key.
</Rule3>

<Rule4>
Equivalent Queries:
SELECT T1.col1, T2.col2 FROM table1 AS T1 INNER JOIN table2 AS T2 ON T1.col3 = T2.col3 WHERE T1.col3 = value;
SELECT table1.col1, table2.col2 FROM table1 INNER JOIN table2 ON table1.col3 = table2.col3 WHERE table1.col3 = value;
Schema Conditions:
table1.col3 is a primary key, and table2.col3 is a foreign key referencing table1.col3.
</Rule4>

<Rule5>
Equivalent Queries:
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM table1 INNER JOIN table2 ON table1.col1 = table2.col2 WHERE condition;
SELECT COUNT(table1.col1) FROM table2 INNER JOIN table1 ON table2.col2 = table1.col1 WHERE condition;
Schema Conditions:
table1.col1 is a non-nullable column that uniquely identifies rows in table1.
</Rule5>

<Rule6>
Equivalent Queries:
SELECT CAST(SUM(column1) AS REAL) / COUNT(column2) FROM table1 INNER JOIN table2 ON table1.col1 = table2.col1 WHERE condition;
SELECT AVG(column1) FROM table1 INNER JOIN table2 ON table1.col1 = table2.col1 WHERE condition;
Schema Conditions:
None.
</Rule6>

<Rule7>
Equivalent Queries:
SELECT COUNT(table1.col1) FROM table1 INNER JOIN table2 ON table1.col1 = table2.col2 INNER JOIN table3 ON table2.col3 = table3.col4 WHERE table1.condition1 = 'value' AND table3.condition2 = 'value';
SELECT COUNT(table3.col4) FROM table3 INNER JOIN table2 ON table3.col4 = table2.col3 INNER JOIN table1 ON table2.col2 = table1.col1 WHERE table1.condition1 = 'value' AND table3.condition2 = 'value';
Schema Conditions:
table1.col1 is a primary key, table3.col4 is a primary key, and table2.col2 and table2.col3 are foreign keys referencing table1.col1 and table3.col4 respectively.
</Rule7>

<Rule8>
Equivalent Queries:
SELECT ... FROM table1 INNER JOIN table2 ON table1.col1 = table2.col1 WHERE table1.col2 = 'value' AND strftime('%Y', table2.date_col) = 'YYYY';
SELECT ... FROM table1 INNER JOIN table2 ON table1.col1 = table2.col1 WHERE table1.col2 = 'value' AND table2.date_col LIKE 'YYYY%';
Schema Conditions:
table2.date_col is consistently formatted as 'YYYY-MM-DD'.
</Rule8>

<Rule9>
Equivalent Queries:
SELECT CAST(SUM(IIF(condition, 1, 0)) AS FLOAT) / SUM(IIF(condition, 1, 0)) FROM table;
SELECT CAST(SUM(CASE WHEN condition THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS REAL) / SUM(CASE WHEN condition THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) FROM table;
Schema Conditions:
None.
</Rule9>

<Rule10>
Equivalent Queries:
SELECT T2.col2 FROM table1 AS T1 INNER JOIN table2 AS T2 ON T1.col1 = T2.col1 WHERE T1.col3 = 'value1' AND T1.col4 = 'value2';
SELECT table2.col2 FROM table2 INNER JOIN table1 ON table2.col1 = table1.col1 WHERE table1.col3 = 'value1' AND table1.col4 = 'value2';
Schema Conditions:
table1.col1 is a foreign key referencing table2.col1, and table2.col1 is a primary key.
</Rule10>

<Rule11>
Equivalent Queries:
SELECT SUM(IIF(condition1, expr1, 0)) - SUM(IIF(condition2, expr2, 0)) FROM table;
SELECT SUM(CASE WHEN condition1 THEN expr1 ELSE 0 END) - SUM(CASE WHEN condition2 THEN expr2 ELSE 0 END) FROM table;
Schema Conditions:
None.
</Rule11>



# Guidelines:
- Make SURE complete to every step PERFECTLY without ANY Mistakes
- Follow the Rules I Gave you and Remember to AVOID generating repeated equivalence rules in the examples I gave you.
- Be sure to format your response like the example equivalence rules I gave you.
- Put <New Rule></New Rule> around the new equivalence rule that you think of. Do not use other formatting around the equivalent queries.
- Use GENERALIZED COLUMN AND TABLE NAMES in any EQUIVALENCE RULE YOU WRITE. DO NOT USE THE SAME NAMES IN THE PROVIDED QUERY PAIRS!!!!
- If the two queries are not logically equivalent, say <New Rule> Not equivalent </New Rule>.
- If the new equivalence rule is already repeated in the examples listed, say <New Rule> Rule exists </New Rule>.
- The new rule should be be MINIMAL to CLEARLY demonstrate the highlighted semantic difference. Use ellipses to shorten SQL queries where necessary to achieve this.

Take a Deep Breath and Carefully Follow the Rules, Guides and Examples I gave you. I will tip you $2000 if you do EVERYTHING Perfectly.

Therefore, we can generate a new equivalence rule:\n\n<New Rule>\nEquivalent Queries:\nSELECT (SUM(CASE WHEN condition1 THEN expr1 ELSE 0 END) * 1.0 - SUM(CASE WHEN condition2 THEN expr2 ELSE 0 END)) * 100 / SUM(CASE WHEN condition2 THEN expr2 ELSE 0 END) FROM table1 INNER JOIN table2 ON table1.col1 = table2.col1;\nSELECT CAST((SUM(CASE WHEN condition1 THEN expr1 ELSE 0 END) - SUM(CASE WHEN condition2 THEN expr2 ELSE 0 END)) AS REAL) * 100 / SUM(CASE WHEN condition2 THEN expr2 ELSE 0 END) FROM table1 INNER JOIN table2 ON table1.col1 = table2.col1;\nSchema Conditions:\nNone.\n", role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None, refusal=None))], created=1730776481, model='gpt-4o-2024-08-06', object='chat.completion', system_fingerprint='fp_45cf54deae', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=887, prompt_tokens=4183, total_tokens=5070, prompt_tokens_details={'cached_tokens': 0}, completion_tokens_details={'reasoning_tokens': 0, 'accepted_prediction_tokens': 0, 'rejected_prediction_tokens': 0}))

INFO:root:model: gpt-4o
INFO:root:prompt: You are an expert SQL engineer with 20+ years of experience. You will be given some SQL equivalence rules conditional on some database schemas. You will then be given a pair of SQL queries, consisting of a gold query and a machine-generated query, and a database schema that defines the context of the queries. 

Your task is to compare the two provided SQL queries on logical equivalence and generate one more equivalence rule in the same format as the provided example equivalence rules.

Please make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please also keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.



Evaluation Criteria:

Logical equivalence - the alignment between the gold SQL query and the machine-generated SQL query. A machine-generated SQL query is logically equivalent to the gold query if these two queries would RETURN THE SAME RESULTS AND IN THE SAME ORDER for ALL POSSIBLE DATABASE INSTANCES that satisfy the provided database schema for these queries. Annotators were asked to penalize machine-generated queries that overlooked edge cases that the gold queries would have caught otherwise.



Evaluation steps:

1. Understand the Database Schema: Identify all tables used in both queries. List all columns referenced, along with their data types and constraints. Determine primary and foreign key relationships. Note any indexes or unique constraints that may affect query execution.
2. Parse and Break Down Each Query: Identify selected columns, functions, and expressions. Note the tables involved and the join conditions. Understand the filtering conditions applied. Identify grouping and aggregate conditions, if any. Determine if result ordering affects equivalence.
3. Compare Query Components: Check if both queries use the same tables and join conditions. Compare filtering conditions in the WHERE clauses. Assess whether the same columns and expressions are selected. Identify if different functions or syntaxes achieve the same result. Look for logical equivalence in expressions and calculations.
4. Consider Edge Cases and Data Variations: Conceptualize sample datasets that include edge cases (e.g., NULL values, zero values, special characters). Analyze how each query handles these edge cases. Ensure that data type differences do not affect the outcome. Verify that constraints (e.g., NOT NULL, UNIQUE) are accounted for.
5. Evaluate Aggregations and Calculations: Confirm that aggregate functions (e.g., SUM, COUNT) are applied identically. Ensure calculations (e.g., subtraction, addition) produce the same results.
6. Check for Logical Equivalence in Conditional Expressions: Compare conditional expressions like IIF, CASE WHEN, and IF. Determine if conditions and returned values are logically the same.
7. Assess Ordering of Results: If ORDER BY clause is present, confirm that both queries order results identically. Recognize that differing order may affect equivalence if result order is significant.
8. Generate a New Logical Equivalence Rule (If Applicable): Create an "Equivalent Queries: <query1>
<query2>
Schema Conditions:<conditions>" statement that defines the equivalence. Use GENERALIZED COLUMN and TABLE NAMES. Specify any necessary conditions based on the database schema. Present the rule clearly, indicating both the equivalence and the conditions under which it holds.



Example Equivalence Rules:

<Rule1>
Equivalent Queries:
SELECT T2.col2 FROM table1 AS T1 INNER JOIN table2 AS T2 ON T1.col1 = T2.col1 WHERE T1.col3 = 'value1' AND T1.col4 = 'value2';
SELECT table2.col2 FROM table2 INNER JOIN table1 ON table2.col1 = table1.col1 WHERE table1.col3 = 'value1' AND table1.col4 = 'value2';
Schema Conditions:
table1.col1 is a foreign key referencing table2.col1, and table2.col1 is a primary key.
</Rule1>

<Rule2>
Equivalent Queries:
SELECT ... FROM table1 INNER JOIN table2 ON table1.col1 = table2.col1 WHERE table1.col2 = 'value' AND strftime('%Y', table2.date_col) = 'YYYY';
SELECT ... FROM table1 INNER JOIN table2 ON table1.col1 = table2.col1 WHERE table1.col2 = 'value' AND table2.date_col LIKE 'YYYY%';
Schema Conditions:
table2.date_col is consistently formatted as 'YYYY-MM-DD'.
</Rule2>

<Rule3>
Equivalent Queries:
SELECT CAST(SUM(IIF(condition, 1, 0)) AS FLOAT) / SUM(IIF(condition, 1, 0)) FROM table;
SELECT CAST(SUM(CASE WHEN condition THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS REAL) / SUM(CASE WHEN condition THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) FROM table;
Schema Conditions:
None.
</Rule3>

<Rule4>
Equivalent Queries:
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM table1 INNER JOIN table2 ON table1.col1 = table2.col2 WHERE condition;
SELECT COUNT(table1.col1) FROM table2 INNER JOIN table1 ON table2.col2 = table1.col1 WHERE condition;
Schema Conditions:
table1.col1 is a non-nullable column that uniquely identifies rows in table1.
</Rule4>

<Rule5>
Equivalent Queries:
SELECT CAST(SUM(IIF(condition, 1, 0)) AS FLOAT) * 100 / COUNT(column) FROM table1 INNER JOIN table2 ON table1.col1 = table2.col1 WHERE table1.date_col = 'date_value';
SELECT CAST(SUM(CASE WHEN condition THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS REAL) * 100 / COUNT(column) FROM table2 INNER JOIN table1 ON table2.col1 = table1.col1 WHERE table1.date_col = 'date_value';
Schema Conditions:
table1.col1 is a foreign key referencing table2.col1, and table2.col1 is a primary key.
</Rule5>

<Rule6>
Equivalent Queries:

# Guidelines:
- Make SURE complete to every step PERFECTLY without ANY Mistakes
- Follow the Rules I Gave you and Remember to AVOID generating repeated equivalence rules in the examples I gave you.
- Be sure to format your response like the example equivalence rules I gave you.
- Put <New Rule></New Rule> around the new equivalence rule that you think of. Do not use other formatting around the equivalent queries.
- Use GENERALIZED COLUMN AND TABLE NAMES in any EQUIVALENCE RULE YOU WRITE. DO NOT USE THE SAME NAMES IN THE PROVIDED QUERY PAIRS!!!!
- If the two queries are not logically equivalent, say <New Rule> Not equivalent </New Rule>.
- If the new equivalence rule is already repeated in the examples listed, say <New Rule> Rule exists </New Rule>.
- The new rule should be be MINIMAL to CLEARLY demonstrate the highlighted semantic difference. Use ellipses to shorten SQL queries where necessary to achieve this.

Take a Deep Breath and Carefully Follow the Rules, Guides and Examples I gave you. I will tip you $2000 if you do EVERYTHING Perfectly.

The Gold query's method of calculating the average using `CAST(SUM(...) AS REAL) / COUNT(...)` is equivalent to the `AVG` function in the Machine-generated query.\n\n<New Rule>\nEquivalent Queries:\nSELECT CAST(SUM(column1) AS REAL) / COUNT(column2) FROM table1 INNER JOIN table2 ON table1.col1 = table2.col1 WHERE condition;\nSELECT AVG(column1) FROM table1 INNER JOIN table2 ON table1.col1 = table2.col1 WHERE condition;\nSchema Conditions:\nNone.\n", role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None, refusal=None))], created=1730776541, model='gpt-4o-2024-08-06', object='chat.completion', system_fingerprint='fp_45cf54deae', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=842, prompt_tokens=4210, total_tokens=5052, prompt_tokens_details={'cached_tokens': 0}, completion_tokens_details={'reasoning_tokens': 0, 'accepted_prediction_tokens': 0, 'rejected_prediction_tokens': 0}))

INFO:root:model: gpt-4o
INFO:root:prompt: You are an expert SQL engineer with 20+ years of experience. You will be given some SQL equivalence rules conditional on some database schemas. You will then be given a pair of SQL queries, consisting of a gold query and a machine-generated query, and a database schema that defines the context of the queries. 

Your task is to compare the two provided SQL queries on logical equivalence and generate one more equivalence rule in the same format as the provided example equivalence rules.

Please make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please also keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.



Evaluation Criteria:

Logical equivalence - the alignment between the gold SQL query and the machine-generated SQL query. A machine-generated SQL query is logically equivalent to the gold query if these two queries would RETURN THE SAME RESULTS AND IN THE SAME ORDER for ALL POSSIBLE DATABASE INSTANCES that satisfy the provided database schema for these queries. Annotators were asked to penalize machine-generated queries that overlooked edge cases that the gold queries would have caught otherwise.



Evaluation steps:

1. Understand the Database Schema: Identify all tables used in both queries. List all columns referenced, along with their data types and constraints. Determine primary and foreign key relationships. Note any indexes or unique constraints that may affect query execution.
2. Parse and Break Down Each Query: Identify selected columns, functions, and expressions. Note the tables involved and the join conditions. Understand the filtering conditions applied. Identify grouping and aggregate conditions, if any. Determine if result ordering affects equivalence.
3. Compare Query Components: Check if both queries use the same tables and join conditions. Compare filtering conditions in the WHERE clauses. Assess whether the same columns and expressions are selected. Identify if different functions or syntaxes achieve the same result. Look for logical equivalence in expressions and calculations.
4. Consider Edge Cases and Data Variations: Conceptualize sample datasets that include edge cases (e.g., NULL values, zero values, special characters). Analyze how each query handles these edge cases. Ensure that data type differences do not affect the outcome. Verify that constraints (e.g., NOT NULL, UNIQUE) are accounted for.
5. Evaluate Aggregations and Calculations: Confirm that aggregate functions (e.g., SUM, COUNT) are applied identically. Ensure calculations (e.g., subtraction, addition) produce the same results.
6. Check for Logical Equivalence in Conditional Expressions: Compare conditional expressions like IIF, CASE WHEN, and IF. Determine if conditions and returned values are logically the same.
7. Assess Ordering of Results: If ORDER BY clause is present, confirm that both queries order results identically. Recognize that differing order may affect equivalence if result order is significant.
8. Generate a New Logical Equivalence Rule (If Applicable): Create an "Equivalent Queries: <query1>
<query2>
Schema Conditions:<conditions>" statement that defines the equivalence. Use GENERALIZED COLUMN and TABLE NAMES. Specify any necessary conditions based on the database schema. Present the rule clearly, indicating both the equivalence and the conditions under which it holds.



Example Equivalence Rules:

<Rule1>
Equivalent Queries:
SELECT SUM(IIF(condition1, expr1, 0)) - SUM(IIF(condition2, expr2, 0)) FROM table;
SELECT SUM(CASE WHEN condition1 THEN expr1 ELSE 0 END) - SUM(CASE WHEN condition2 THEN expr2 ELSE 0 END) FROM table;
Schema Conditions:
None.
</Rule1>

<Rule2>
Equivalent Queries:
SELECT ... FROM table1 INNER JOIN table2 ON table1.col1 = table2.col1 WHERE table1.col2 = 'value' AND strftime('%Y', table2.date_col) = 'YYYY';
SELECT ... FROM table1 INNER JOIN table2 ON table1.col1 = table2.col1 WHERE table1.col2 = 'value' AND table2.date_col LIKE 'YYYY%';
Schema Conditions:
table2.date_col is consistently formatted as 'YYYY-MM-DD'.
</Rule2>

<Rule3>
Equivalent Queries:
SELECT CAST(SUM(column1) AS REAL) / COUNT(column2) FROM table1 INNER JOIN table2 ON table1.col1 = table2.col1 WHERE condition;
SELECT AVG(column1) FROM table1 INNER JOIN table2 ON table1.col1 = table2.col1 WHERE condition;
Schema Conditions:
None.
</Rule3>

<Rule4>
Equivalent Queries:
SELECT T1.col1, T2.col2 FROM table1 AS T1 INNER JOIN table2 AS T2 ON T1.col3 = T2.col3 WHERE T1.col3 = value;
SELECT table1.col1, table2.col2 FROM table1 INNER JOIN table2 ON table1.col3 = table2.col3 WHERE table1.col3 = value;
Schema Conditions:
table1.col3 is a primary key, and table2.col3 is a foreign key referencing table1.col3.
</Rule4>

<Rule5>
Equivalent Queries:
SELECT CAST(SUM(IIF(condition, 1, 0)) AS FLOAT) / SUM(IIF(condition, 1, 0)) FROM table;
SELECT CAST(SUM(CASE WHEN condition THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS REAL) / SUM(CASE WHEN condition THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) FROM table;
Schema Conditions:
None.
</Rule5>

<Rule6>
Equivalent Queries:
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM table1 INNER JOIN table2 ON table1.col1 = table2.col2 WHERE condition;
SELECT COUNT(table1.col1) FROM table2 INNER JOIN table1 ON table2.col2 = table1.col1 WHERE condition;
Schema Conditions:
table1.col1 is a non-nullable column that uniquely identifies rows in table1.
</Rule6>

<Rule7>
Equivalent Queries:
SELECT (SUM(CASE WHEN condition1 THEN expr1 ELSE 0 END) * 1.0 - SUM(CASE WHEN condition2 THEN expr2 ELSE 0 END)) * 100 / SUM(CASE WHEN condition2 THEN expr2 ELSE 0 END) FROM table1 INNER JOIN table2 ON table1.col1 = table2.col1;
SELECT CAST((SUM(CASE WHEN condition1 THEN expr1 ELSE 0 END) - SUM(CASE WHEN condition2 THEN expr2 ELSE 0 END)) AS REAL) * 100 / SUM(CASE WHEN condition2 THEN expr2 ELSE 0 END) FROM table1 INNER JOIN table2 ON table1.col1 = table2.col1;
Schema Conditions:
None.
</Rule7>

<Rule8>
Equivalent Queries:
SELECT column_name FROM table_name WHERE SUBSTR(date_column, 1, 7) = 'YYYY-MM';
SELECT column_name FROM table_name WHERE date_column LIKE 'YYYY-MM%';
Schema Conditions:
None.
</Rule8>

<Rule9>
Equivalent Queries:
SELECT T2.col2 FROM table1 AS T1 INNER JOIN table2 AS T2 ON T1.col1 = T2.col1 WHERE T1.col3 = 'value1' AND T1.col4 = 'value2';
SELECT table2.col2 FROM table2 INNER JOIN table1 ON table2.col1 = table1.col1 WHERE table1.col3 = 'value1' AND table1.col4 = 'value2';
Schema Conditions:
table1.col1 is a foreign key referencing table2.col1, and table2.col1 is a primary key.
</Rule9>

<Rule10>
Equivalent Queries:
SELECT ... FROM table WHERE condition1 AND condition2;
SELECT ... FROM table WHERE condition2 AND condition1;
Schema Conditions:
None.
</Rule10>

<Rule11>
Equivalent Queries:
SELECT CAST(SUM(IIF(condition, 1, 0)) AS FLOAT) * 100 / COUNT(column) FROM table1 INNER JOIN table2 ON table1.col1 = table2.col1 WHERE table1.date_col = 'date_value';
SELECT CAST(SUM(CASE WHEN condition THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS REAL) * 100 / COUNT(column) FROM table2 INNER JOIN table1 ON table2.col1 = table1.col1 WHERE table1.date_col = 'date_value';
Schema Conditions:
table1.col1 is a foreign key referencing table2.col1, and table2.col1 is a primary key.
</Rule11>

<Rule12>
Equivalent Queries:
SELECT COUNT(table1.col1) FROM table1 INNER JOIN table2 ON table1.col1 = table2.col2 INNER JOIN table3 ON table2.col3 = table3.col4 WHERE table1.condition1 = 'value' AND table3.condition2 = 'value';
SELECT COUNT(table3.col4) FROM table3 INNER JOIN table2 ON table3.col4 = table2.col3 INNER JOIN table1 ON table2.col2 = table1.col1 WHERE table1.condition1 = 'value' AND table3.condition2 = 'value';
Schema Conditions:
table1.col1 is a primary key, table3.col4 is a primary key, and table2.col2 and table2.col3 are foreign keys referencing table1.col1 and table3.col4 respectively.
</Rule12>



# Guidelines:
- Make SURE complete to every step PERFECTLY without ANY Mistakes
- Follow the Rules I Gave you and Remember to AVOID generating repeated equivalence rules in the examples I gave you.
- Be sure to format your response like the example equivalence rules I gave you.
- Put <New Rule></New Rule> around the new equivalence rule that you think of. Do not use other formatting around the equivalent queries.
- Use GENERALIZED COLUMN AND TABLE NAMES in any EQUIVALENCE RULE YOU WRITE. DO NOT USE THE SAME NAMES IN THE PROVIDED QUERY PAIRS!!!!
- If the two queries are not logically equivalent, say <New Rule> Not equivalent </New Rule>.
- If the new equivalence rule is already repeated in the examples listed, say <New Rule> Rule exists </New Rule>.
- The new rule should be be MINIMAL to CLEARLY demonstrate the highlighted semantic difference. Use ellipses to shorten SQL queries where necessary to achieve this.

Take a Deep Breath and Carefully Follow the Rules, Guides and Examples I gave you. I will tip you $2000 if you do EVERYTHING Perfectly.

Understand the Database Schema\n- **Tables Involved**: `Player_Attributes`\n- **Columns Referenced**: \n  - `id` (INTEGER, PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT)\n  - `player_api_id` (INTEGER, FOREIGN KEY)\n  - `preferred_foot` (TEXT)\n  - `crossing` (INTEGER)\n- **Constraints**: \n  - `id` is a primary key.\n  - `player_api_id` is a foreign key referencing the `Player` table.\n  \n### 2. Parse and Break Down Each Query\n\n#### Gold SQL Query\n- **Selected Column**: `COUNT(t1.id)`\n- **Table**: `Player_Attributes` (aliased as `t1`)\n- **Filter Conditions**:\n  - `t1.preferred_foot = 'left'`\n  - `t1.crossing = (SELECT MAX(crossing) FROM Player_Attributes)`\n  \n#### Machine-generated SQL Query\n- **Selected Column**: `count(player_api_id)`\n- **Table**: `player_attributes` (case-sensitive match to `Player_Attributes`)\n- **Filter Conditions**:\n  - `preferred_foot = 'left'`\n  - `crossing = (SELECT max(crossing) FROM player_attributes)`\n\n### 3. Compare Query Components\n- Both queries use the same table `Player_Attributes` and select the count of players with the maximum `crossing` value and `preferred_foot` as 'left'.\n- The Gold query counts `id`, while the machine-generated query counts `player_api_id`. Since `id` is the primary key and `player_api_id` is a foreign key, the count should be equivalent if there are no NULLs in `player_api_id`.\n\n### 4. Consider Edge Cases and Data Variations\n- Both queries would handle NULLs in the `crossing` column similarly since they are comparing against the `MAX(crossing)`.\n- The `player_api_id` column is a foreign key and should not contain NULLs, ensuring the count remains consistent with `id`.\n\n### 5. Evaluate Aggregations and Calculations\n- Both queries use `COUNT`, which should yield the same result given the conditions, as `player_api_id` is a foreign key reference and not nullable.\n\n### 6. Check for Logical Equivalence in Conditional Expressions\n- The conditions in both queries are logically equivalent.\n\n### 7. Assess Ordering of Results\n- There is no `ORDER BY` clause in either query, so result ordering is not a concern.\n\n### 8. Generate a New Logical Equivalence Rule (If Applicable)\nSince the queries are logically equivalent based on the schema, we can generate a new equivalence rule:\n\n<New Rule>\nEquivalent Queries:\nSELECT COUNT(primary_key_col) FROM table WHERE condition1 AND column = (SELECT MAX(column) FROM table);\nSELECT COUNT(foreign_key_col) FROM table WHERE condition1 AND column = (SELECT MAX(column) FROM table);\nSchema Conditions:\nforeign_key_col is a non-nullable foreign key.\n", role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None, refusal=None))], created=1730776616, model='gpt-4o-2024-08-06', object='chat.completion', system_fingerprint='fp_45cf54deae', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=655, prompt_tokens=4191, total_tokens=4846, prompt_tokens_details={'cached_tokens': 0}, completion_tokens_details={'reasoning_tokens': 0, 'accepted_prediction_tokens': 0, 'rejected_prediction_tokens': 0}))

INFO:root:model: gpt-4o
INFO:root:prompt: You are an expert SQL engineer with 20+ years of experience. You will be given some SQL equivalence rules conditional on some database schemas. You will then be given a pair of SQL queries, consisting of a gold query and a machine-generated query, and a database schema that defines the context of the queries. 

Your task is to compare the two provided SQL queries on logical equivalence and generate one more equivalence rule in the same format as the provided example equivalence rules.

Please make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please also keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.



Evaluation Criteria:

Logical equivalence - the alignment between the gold SQL query and the machine-generated SQL query. A machine-generated SQL query is logically equivalent to the gold query if these two queries would RETURN THE SAME RESULTS AND IN THE SAME ORDER for ALL POSSIBLE DATABASE INSTANCES that satisfy the provided database schema for these queries. Annotators were asked to penalize machine-generated queries that overlooked edge cases that the gold queries would have caught otherwise.



Evaluation steps:

1. Understand the Database Schema: Identify all tables used in both queries. List all columns referenced, along with their data types and constraints. Determine primary and foreign key relationships. Note any indexes or unique constraints that may affect query execution.
2. Parse and Break Down Each Query: Identify selected columns, functions, and expressions. Note the tables involved and the join conditions. Understand the filtering conditions applied. Identify grouping and aggregate conditions, if any. Determine if result ordering affects equivalence.
3. Compare Query Components: Check if both queries use the same tables and join conditions. Compare filtering conditions in the WHERE clauses. Assess whether the same columns and expressions are selected. Identify if different functions or syntaxes achieve the same result. Look for logical equivalence in expressions and calculations.
4. Consider Edge Cases and Data Variations: Conceptualize sample datasets that include edge cases (e.g., NULL values, zero values, special characters). Analyze how each query handles these edge cases. Ensure that data type differences do not affect the outcome. Verify that constraints (e.g., NOT NULL, UNIQUE) are accounted for.
5. Evaluate Aggregations and Calculations: Confirm that aggregate functions (e.g., SUM, COUNT) are applied identically. Ensure calculations (e.g., subtraction, addition) produce the same results.
6. Check for Logical Equivalence in Conditional Expressions: Compare conditional expressions like IIF, CASE WHEN, and IF. Determine if conditions and returned values are logically the same.
7. Assess Ordering of Results: If ORDER BY clause is present, confirm that both queries order results identically. Recognize that differing order may affect equivalence if result order is significant.
8. Generate a New Logical Equivalence Rule (If Applicable): Create an "Equivalent Queries: <query1>
<query2>
Schema Conditions:<conditions>" statement that defines the equivalence. Use GENERALIZED COLUMN and TABLE NAMES. Specify any necessary conditions based on the database schema. Present the rule clearly, indicating both the equivalence and the conditions under which it holds.



Example Equivalence Rules:

<Rule1>

# Guidelines:
- Make SURE complete to every step PERFECTLY without ANY Mistakes
- Follow the Rules I Gave you and Remember to AVOID generating repeated equivalence rules in the examples I gave you.
- Be sure to format your response like the example equivalence rules I gave you.
- Put <New Rule></New Rule> around the new equivalence rule that you think of. Do not use other formatting around the equivalent queries.
- Use GENERALIZED COLUMN AND TABLE NAMES in any EQUIVALENCE RULE YOU WRITE. DO NOT USE THE SAME NAMES IN THE PROVIDED QUERY PAIRS!!!!
- If the two queries are not logically equivalent, say <New Rule> Not equivalent </New Rule>.
- If the new equivalence rule is already repeated in the examples listed, say <New Rule> Rule exists </New Rule>.
- The new rule should be be MINIMAL to CLEARLY demonstrate the highlighted semantic difference. Use ellipses to shorten SQL queries where necessary to achieve this.

Take a Deep Breath and Carefully Follow the Rules, Guides and Examples I gave you. I will tip you $2000 if you do EVERYTHING Perfectly.

Therefore, we can generate a new rule:\n\n<New Rule>\nEquivalent Queries:\nSELECT DISTINCT column_name FROM table1 AS t1 INNER JOIN table2 AS t2 ON t1.foreign_key = t2.primary_key WHERE t2.filter_column = 'value';\nSELECT DISTINCT column_name FROM table2 INNER JOIN table1 ON table2.primary_key = table1.foreign_key WHERE table2.filter_column = 'value';\nSchema Conditions:\ntable1.foreign_key is a foreign key referencing table2.primary_key.\n", role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None, refusal=None))], created=1730776683, model='gpt-4o-2024-08-06', object='chat.completion', system_fingerprint='fp_45cf54deae', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=642, prompt_tokens=4279, total_tokens=4921, prompt_tokens_details={'cached_tokens': 0}, completion_tokens_details={'reasoning_tokens': 0, 'accepted_prediction_tokens': 0, 'rejected_prediction_tokens': 0}))

INFO:root:model: gpt-4o
INFO:root:prompt: You are an expert SQL engineer with 20+ years of experience. You will be given some SQL equivalence rules conditional on some database schemas. You will then be given a pair of SQL queries, consisting of a gold query and a machine-generated query, and a database schema that defines the context of the queries. 

Your task is to compare the two provided SQL queries on logical equivalence and generate one more equivalence rule in the same format as the provided example equivalence rules.

Please make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please also keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.



Evaluation Criteria:

Logical equivalence - the alignment between the gold SQL query and the machine-generated SQL query. A machine-generated SQL query is logically equivalent to the gold query if these two queries would RETURN THE SAME RESULTS AND IN THE SAME ORDER for ALL POSSIBLE DATABASE INSTANCES that satisfy the provided database schema for these queries. Annotators were asked to penalize machine-generated queries that overlooked edge cases that the gold queries would have caught otherwise.



Evaluation steps:

1. Understand the Database Schema: Identify all tables used in both queries. List all columns referenced, along with their data types and constraints. Determine primary and foreign key relationships. Note any indexes or unique constraints that may affect query execution.
2. Parse and Break Down Each Query: Identify selected columns, functions, and expressions. Note the tables involved and the join conditions. Understand the filtering conditions applied. Identify grouping and aggregate conditions, if any. Determine if result ordering affects equivalence.
3. Compare Query Components: Check if both queries use the same tables and join conditions. Compare filtering conditions in the WHERE clauses. Assess whether the same columns and expressions are selected. Identify if different functions or syntaxes achieve the same result. Look for logical equivalence in expressions and calculations.
4. Consider Edge Cases and Data Variations: Conceptualize sample datasets that include edge cases (e.g., NULL values, zero values, special characters). Analyze how each query handles these edge cases. Ensure that data type differences do not affect the outcome. Verify that constraints (e.g., NOT NULL, UNIQUE) are accounted for.
5. Evaluate Aggregations and Calculations: Confirm that aggregate functions (e.g., SUM, COUNT) are applied identically. Ensure calculations (e.g., subtraction, addition) produce the same results.
6. Check for Logical Equivalence in Conditional Expressions: Compare conditional expressions like IIF, CASE WHEN, and IF. Determine if conditions and returned values are logically the same.
7. Assess Ordering of Results: If ORDER BY clause is present, confirm that both queries order results identically. Recognize that differing order may affect equivalence if result order is significant.
8. Generate a New Logical Equivalence Rule (If Applicable): Create an "Equivalent Queries: <query1>
<query2>
Schema Conditions:<conditions>" statement that defines the equivalence. Use GENERALIZED COLUMN and TABLE NAMES. Specify any necessary conditions based on the database schema. Present the rule clearly, indicating both the equivalence and the conditions under which it holds.



Example Equivalence Rules:

<Rule1>
Equivalent Queries:
SELECT SUM(IIF(condition1, expr1, 0)) - SUM(IIF(condition2, expr2, 0)) FROM table;

SELECT COUNT(table3.col4) FROM table3 INNER JOIN table2 ON table3.col4 = table2.col3 INNER JOIN table1 ON table2.col2 = table1.col1 WHERE table1.condition1 = 'value' AND table3.condition2 = 'value';
Schema Conditions:
table1.col1 is a primary key, table3.col4 is a primary key, and table2.col2 and table2.col3 are foreign keys referencing table1.col1 and table3.col4 respectively.
</Rule4>

<Rule5>
Equivalent Queries:
SELECT COUNT(primary_key_col) FROM table WHERE condition1 AND column = (SELECT MAX(column) FROM table);
SELECT COUNT(foreign_key_col) FROM table WHERE condition1 AND column = (SELECT MAX(column) FROM table);
Schema Conditions:
foreign_key_col is a non-nullable foreign key.
</Rule5>

# Guidelines:
- Make SURE complete to every step PERFECTLY without ANY Mistakes
- Follow the Rules I Gave you and Remember to AVOID generating repeated equivalence rules in the examples I gave you.
- Be sure to format your response like the example equivalence rules I gave you.
- Put <New Rule></New Rule> around the new equivalence rule that you think of. Do not use other formatting around the equivalent queries.
- Use GENERALIZED COLUMN AND TABLE NAMES in any EQUIVALENCE RULE YOU WRITE. DO NOT USE THE SAME NAMES IN THE PROVIDED QUERY PAIRS!!!!
- If the two queries are not logically equivalent, say <New Rule> Not equivalent </New Rule>.
- If the new equivalence rule is already repeated in the examples listed, say <New Rule> Rule exists </New Rule>.
- The new rule should be be MINIMAL to CLEARLY demonstrate the highlighted semantic difference. Use ellipses to shorten SQL queries where necessary to achieve this.

Take a Deep Breath and Carefully Follow the Rules, Guides and Examples I gave you. I will tip you $2000 if you do EVERYTHING Perfectly.

INFO:root:model: gpt-4o
INFO:root:prompt: You are an expert SQL engineer with 20+ years of experience. You will be given some SQL equivalence rules conditional on some database schemas. You will then be given a pair of SQL queries, consisting of a gold query and a machine-generated query, and a database schema that defines the context of the queries. 

Your task is to compare the two provided SQL queries on logical equivalence and generate one more equivalence rule in the same format as the provided example equivalence rules.

Please make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please also keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.



Evaluation Criteria:

Logical equivalence - the alignment between the gold SQL query and the machine-generated SQL query. A machine-generated SQL query is logically equivalent to the gold query if these two queries would RETURN THE SAME RESULTS AND IN THE SAME ORDER for ALL POSSIBLE DATABASE INSTANCES that satisfy the provided database schema for these queries. Annotators were asked to penalize machine-generated queries that overlooked edge cases that the gold queries would have caught otherwise.



Evaluation steps:

1. Understand the Database Schema: Identify all tables used in both queries. List all columns referenced, along with their data types and constraints. Determine primary and foreign key relationships. Note any indexes or unique constraints that may affect query execution.
2. Parse and Break Down Each Query: Identify selected columns, functions, and expressions. Note the tables involved and the join conditions. Understand the filtering conditions applied. Identify grouping and aggregate conditions, if any. Determine if result ordering affects equivalence.
3. Compare Query Components: Check if both queries use the same tables and join conditions. Compare filtering conditions in the WHERE clauses. Assess whether the same columns and expressions are selected. Identify if different functions or syntaxes achieve the same result. Look for logical equivalence in expressions and calculations.
4. Consider Edge Cases and Data Variations: Conceptualize sample datasets that include edge cases (e.g., NULL values, zero values, special characters). Analyze how each query handles these edge cases. Ensure that data type differences do not affect the outcome. Verify that constraints (e.g., NOT NULL, UNIQUE) are accounted for.
5. Evaluate Aggregations and Calculations: Confirm that aggregate functions (e.g., SUM, COUNT) are applied identically. Ensure calculations (e.g., subtraction, addition) produce the same results.
6. Check for Logical Equivalence in Conditional Expressions: Compare conditional expressions like IIF, CASE WHEN, and IF. Determine if conditions and returned values are logically the same.
7. Assess Ordering of Results: If ORDER BY clause is present, confirm that both queries order results identically. Recognize that differing order may affect equivalence if result order is significant.
8. Generate a New Logical Equivalence Rule (If Applicable): Create an "Equivalent Queries: <query1>
<query2>
Schema Conditions:<conditions>" statement that defines the equivalence. Use GENERALIZED COLUMN and TABLE NAMES. Specify any necessary conditions based on the database schema. Present the rule clearly, indicating both the equivalence and the conditions under which it holds.



Example Equivalence Rules:

<Rule1>
Equivalent Queries:
SELECT (SUM(CASE WHEN condition1 THEN expr1 ELSE 0 END) * 1.0 - SUM(CASE WHEN condition2 THEN expr2 ELSE 0 END)) * 100 / SUM(CASE WHEN condition2 THEN expr2 ELSE 0 END) FROM table1 INNER JOIN table2 ON table1.col1 = table2.col1;
SELECT CAST((SUM(CASE WHEN condition1 THEN expr1 ELSE 0 END) - SUM(CASE WHEN condition2 THEN expr2 ELSE 0 END)) AS REAL) * 100 / SUM(CASE WHEN condition2 THEN expr2 ELSE 0 END) FROM table1 INNER JOIN table2 ON table1.col1 = table2.col1;
Schema Conditions:
None.
</Rule1>

<Rule2>

SELECT COUNT(table3.col4) FROM table3 INNER JOIN table2 ON table3.col4 = table2.col3 INNER JOIN table1 ON table2.col2 = table1.col1 WHERE table1.condition1 = 'value' AND table3.condition2 = 'value';
Schema Conditions:
table1.col1 is a primary key, table3.col4 is a primary key, and table2.col2 and table2.col3 are foreign keys referencing table1.col1 and table3.col4 respectively.
</Rule3>

<Rule4>
Equivalent Queries:
SELECT SUM(IIF(condition1, expr1, 0)) - SUM(IIF(condition2, expr2, 0)) FROM table;
SELECT SUM(CASE WHEN condition1 THEN expr1 ELSE 0 END) - SUM(CASE WHEN condition2 THEN expr2 ELSE 0 END) FROM table;
Schema Conditions:
None.
</Rule4>

<Rule5>
Equivalent Queries:
SELECT T2.col2 FROM table1 AS T1 INNER JOIN table2 AS T2 ON T1.col1 = T2.col1 WHERE T1.col3 = 'value1' AND T1.col4 = 'value2';
SELECT table2.col2 FROM table2 INNER JOIN table1 ON table2.col1 = table1.col1 WHERE table1.col3 = 'value1' AND table1.col4 = 'value2';
Schema Conditions:
table1.col1 is a foreign key referencing table2.col1, and table2.col1 is a primary key.
</Rule5>

<Rule6>
Equivalent Queries:
SELECT CAST(SUM(IIF(condition, 1, 0)) AS FLOAT) / SUM(IIF(condition, 1, 0)) FROM table;
SELECT CAST(SUM(CASE WHEN condition THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS REAL) / SUM(CASE WHEN condition THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) FROM table;
Schema Conditions:
None.
</Rule6>

<Rule7>
Equivalent Queries:
SELECT CAST(SUM(column1) AS REAL) / COUNT(column2) FROM table1 INNER JOIN table2 ON table1.col1 = table2.col1 WHERE condition;
SELECT AVG(column1) FROM table1 INNER JOIN table2 ON table1.col1 = table2.col1 WHERE condition;
Schema Conditions:
None.
</Rule7>

<Rule8>
Equivalent Queries:
SELECT COUNT(primary_key_col) FROM table WHERE condition1 AND column = (SELECT MAX(column) FROM table);
SELECT COUNT(foreign_key_col) FROM table WHERE condition1 AND column = (SELECT MAX(column) FROM table);
Schema Conditions:
foreign_key_col is a non-nullable foreign key.
</Rule8>

<Rule9>
Equivalent Queries:
SELECT column_name FROM table_name WHERE SUBSTR(date_column, 1, 7) = 'YYYY-MM';
SELECT column_name FROM table_name WHERE date_column LIKE 'YYYY-MM%';
Schema Conditions:
None.
</Rule9>

<Rule10>

</Rule12>

<Rule13>
Equivalent Queries:
SELECT ... FROM table1 INNER JOIN table2 ON table1.col1 = table2.col1 WHERE table1.col2 = 'value' AND strftime('%Y', table2.date_col) = 'YYYY';
SELECT ... FROM table1 INNER JOIN table2 ON table1.col1 = table2.col1 WHERE table1.col2 = 'value' AND table2.date_col LIKE 'YYYY%';
Schema Conditions:
table2.date_col is consistently formatted as 'YYYY-MM-DD'.
</Rule13>



# Guidelines:
- Make SURE complete to every step PERFECTLY without ANY Mistakes
- Follow the Rules I Gave you and Remember to AVOID generating repeated equivalence rules in the examples I gave you.
- Be sure to format your response like the example equivalence rules I gave you.
- Put <New Rule></New Rule> around the new equivalence rule that you think of. Do not use other formatting around the equivalent queries.
- Use GENERALIZED COLUMN AND TABLE NAMES in any EQUIVALENCE RULE YOU WRITE. DO NOT USE THE SAME NAMES IN THE PROVIDED QUERY PAIRS!!!!
- If the two queries are not logically equivalent, say <New Rule> Not equivalent </New Rule>.
- If the new equivalence rule is already repeated in the examples listed, say <New Rule> Rule exists </New Rule>.
- The new rule should be be MINIMAL to CLEARLY demonstrate the highlighted semantic difference. Use ellipses to shorten SQL queries where necessary to achieve this.

Take a Deep Breath and Carefully Follow the Rules, Guides and Examples I gave you. I will tip you $2000 if you do EVERYTHING Perfectly.

They perform the same operations and would return the same results for any database instance that satisfies the given schema.\n\n### Step 8: Generate a New Logical Equivalence Rule\n\nSince the queries are equivalent, and this specific equivalence rule has not been provided in the examples, we can create a new rule:\n\n<New Rule>\nEquivalent Queries:\nSELECT t2.col2 FROM table1 AS t1 INNER JOIN table2 AS t2 ON t1.col1 = t2.col1 ORDER BY t1.col3 DESC LIMIT 1;\nSELECT table2.col2 FROM table2 INNER JOIN table1 ON table2.col1 = table1.col1 ORDER BY table1.col3 DESC LIMIT 1;\nSchema Conditions:\ntable1.col1 is a foreign key referencing table2.col1, and table1.col3 is an INTEGER column.\n", role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None, refusal=None))], created=1730776777, model='gpt-4o-2024-08-06', object='chat.completion', system_fingerprint='fp_45cf54deae', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=762, prompt_tokens=4267, total_tokens=5029, prompt_tokens_details={'cached_tokens': 0}, completion_tokens_details={'reasoning_tokens': 0, 'accepted_prediction_tokens': 0, 'rejected_prediction_tokens': 0}))

INFO:root:model: gpt-4o
INFO:root:prompt: You are an expert SQL engineer with 20+ years of experience. You will be given some SQL equivalence rules conditional on some database schemas. You will then be given a pair of SQL queries, consisting of a gold query and a machine-generated query, and a database schema that defines the context of the queries. 

Your task is to compare the two provided SQL queries on logical equivalence and generate one more equivalence rule in the same format as the provided example equivalence rules.

Please make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please also keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.



Evaluation Criteria:

Logical equivalence - the alignment between the gold SQL query and the machine-generated SQL query. A machine-generated SQL query is logically equivalent to the gold query if these two queries would RETURN THE SAME RESULTS AND IN THE SAME ORDER for ALL POSSIBLE DATABASE INSTANCES that satisfy the provided database schema for these queries. Annotators were asked to penalize machine-generated queries that overlooked edge cases that the gold queries would have caught otherwise.



Evaluation steps:

1. Understand the Database Schema: Identify all tables used in both queries. List all columns referenced, along with their data types and constraints. Determine primary and foreign key relationships. Note any indexes or unique constraints that may affect query execution.
2. Parse and Break Down Each Query: Identify selected columns, functions, and expressions. Note the tables involved and the join conditions. Understand the filtering conditions applied. Identify grouping and aggregate conditions, if any. Determine if result ordering affects equivalence.
3. Compare Query Components: Check if both queries use the same tables and join conditions. Compare filtering conditions in the WHERE clauses. Assess whether the same columns and expressions are selected. Identify if different functions or syntaxes achieve the same result. Look for logical equivalence in expressions and calculations.
4. Consider Edge Cases and Data Variations: Conceptualize sample datasets that include edge cases (e.g., NULL values, zero values, special characters). Analyze how each query handles these edge cases. Ensure that data type differences do not affect the outcome. Verify that constraints (e.g., NOT NULL, UNIQUE) are accounted for.
5. Evaluate Aggregations and Calculations: Confirm that aggregate functions (e.g., SUM, COUNT) are applied identically. Ensure calculations (e.g., subtraction, addition) produce the same results.
6. Check for Logical Equivalence in Conditional Expressions: Compare conditional expressions like IIF, CASE WHEN, and IF. Determine if conditions and returned values are logically the same.
7. Assess Ordering of Results: If ORDER BY clause is present, confirm that both queries order results identically. Recognize that differing order may affect equivalence if result order is significant.
8. Generate a New Logical Equivalence Rule (If Applicable): Create an "Equivalent Queries: <query1>
<query2>
Schema Conditions:<conditions>" statement that defines the equivalence. Use GENERALIZED COLUMN and TABLE NAMES. Specify any necessary conditions based on the database schema. Present the rule clearly, indicating both the equivalence and the conditions under which it holds.



Example Equivalence Rules:

<Rule1>
Equivalent Queries:
SELECT CAST(SUM(column1) AS REAL) / COUNT(column2) FROM table1 INNER JOIN table2 ON table1.col1 = table2.col1 WHERE condition;
SELECT AVG(column1) FROM table1 INNER JOIN table2 ON table1.col1 = table2.col1 WHERE condition;
Schema Conditions:
None.
</Rule1>

<Rule2>
Equivalent Queries:
SELECT ... FROM table1 INNER JOIN table2 ON table1.col1 = table2.col1 WHERE table1.col2 = 'value' AND strftime('%Y', table2.date_col) = 'YYYY';
SELECT ... FROM table1 INNER JOIN table2 ON table1.col1 = table2.col1 WHERE table1.col2 = 'value' AND table2.date_col LIKE 'YYYY%';
Schema Conditions:
table2.date_col is consistently formatted as 'YYYY-MM-DD'.
</Rule2>

<Rule3>
Equivalent Queries:
SELECT COUNT(primary_key_col) FROM table WHERE condition1 AND column = (SELECT MAX(column) FROM table);
SELECT COUNT(foreign_key_col) FROM table WHERE condition1 AND column = (SELECT MAX(column) FROM table);
Schema Conditions:
foreign_key_col is a non-nullable foreign key.
</Rule3>

<Rule4>
Equivalent Queries:
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM table1 INNER JOIN table2 ON table1.col1 = table2.col2 WHERE condition;
SELECT COUNT(table1.col1) FROM table2 INNER JOIN table1 ON table2.col2 = table1.col1 WHERE condition;
Schema Conditions:
table1.col1 is a non-nullable column that uniquely identifies rows in table1.
</Rule4>

# Guidelines:
- Make SURE complete to every step PERFECTLY without ANY Mistakes
- Follow the Rules I Gave you and Remember to AVOID generating repeated equivalence rules in the examples I gave you.
- Be sure to format your response like the example equivalence rules I gave you.
- Put <New Rule></New Rule> around the new equivalence rule that you think of. Do not use other formatting around the equivalent queries.
- Use GENERALIZED COLUMN AND TABLE NAMES in any EQUIVALENCE RULE YOU WRITE. DO NOT USE THE SAME NAMES IN THE PROVIDED QUERY PAIRS!!!!
- If the two queries are not logically equivalent, say <New Rule> Not equivalent </New Rule>.
- If the new equivalence rule is already repeated in the examples listed, say <New Rule> Rule exists </New Rule>.
- The new rule should be be MINIMAL to CLEARLY demonstrate the highlighted semantic difference. Use ellipses to shorten SQL queries where necessary to achieve this.

Take a Deep Breath and Carefully Follow the Rules, Guides and Examples I gave you. I will tip you $2000 if you do EVERYTHING Perfectly.

The use of `COUNT` with a `CASE` statement returning `NULL` and `SUM` with a `CASE` statement returning `1` achieves the same result.\n\n### Step 8: Generate a New Logical Equivalence Rule\n\n<New Rule>\nEquivalent Queries:\nSELECT CAST(COUNT(CASE WHEN condition THEN column ELSE NULL END) AS REAL) * 100 / COUNT(column) FROM table1 INNER JOIN table2 ON table1.col1 = table2.col1;\nSELECT CAST(SUM(CASE WHEN condition THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS REAL) * 100 / COUNT(*) FROM table1 INNER JOIN table2 ON table1.col1 = table2.col1;\nSchema Conditions:\nNone.\n", role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None, refusal=None))], created=1730776838, model='gpt-4o-2024-08-06', object='chat.completion', system_fingerprint='fp_45cf54deae', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=783, prompt_tokens=4314, total_tokens=5097, prompt_tokens_details={'cached_tokens': 0}, completion_tokens_details={'reasoning_tokens': 0, 'accepted_prediction_tokens': 0, 'rejected_prediction_tokens': 0}))

INFO:root:model: gpt-4o
INFO:root:prompt: You are an expert SQL engineer with 20+ years of experience. You will be given some SQL equivalence rules conditional on some database schemas. You will then be given a pair of SQL queries, consisting of a gold query and a machine-generated query, and a database schema that defines the context of the queries. 

Your task is to compare the two provided SQL queries on logical equivalence and generate one more equivalence rule in the same format as the provided example equivalence rules.

Please make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please also keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.



Evaluation Criteria:

Logical equivalence - the alignment between the gold SQL query and the machine-generated SQL query. A machine-generated SQL query is logically equivalent to the gold query if these two queries would RETURN THE SAME RESULTS AND IN THE SAME ORDER for ALL POSSIBLE DATABASE INSTANCES that satisfy the provided database schema for these queries. Annotators were asked to penalize machine-generated queries that overlooked edge cases that the gold queries would have caught otherwise.



Evaluation steps:

1. Understand the Database Schema: Identify all tables used in both queries. List all columns referenced, along with their data types and constraints. Determine primary and foreign key relationships. Note any indexes or unique constraints that may affect query execution.
2. Parse and Break Down Each Query: Identify selected columns, functions, and expressions. Note the tables involved and the join conditions. Understand the filtering conditions applied. Identify grouping and aggregate conditions, if any. Determine if result ordering affects equivalence.
3. Compare Query Components: Check if both queries use the same tables and join conditions. Compare filtering conditions in the WHERE clauses. Assess whether the same columns and expressions are selected. Identify if different functions or syntaxes achieve the same result. Look for logical equivalence in expressions and calculations.
4. Consider Edge Cases and Data Variations: Conceptualize sample datasets that include edge cases (e.g., NULL values, zero values, special characters). Analyze how each query handles these edge cases. Ensure that data type differences do not affect the outcome. Verify that constraints (e.g., NOT NULL, UNIQUE) are accounted for.
5. Evaluate Aggregations and Calculations: Confirm that aggregate functions (e.g., SUM, COUNT) are applied identically. Ensure calculations (e.g., subtraction, addition) produce the same results.
6. Check for Logical Equivalence in Conditional Expressions: Compare conditional expressions like IIF, CASE WHEN, and IF. Determine if conditions and returned values are logically the same.
7. Assess Ordering of Results: If ORDER BY clause is present, confirm that both queries order results identically. Recognize that differing order may affect equivalence if result order is significant.
8. Generate a New Logical Equivalence Rule (If Applicable): Create an "Equivalent Queries: <query1>
<query2>
Schema Conditions:<conditions>" statement that defines the equivalence. Use GENERALIZED COLUMN and TABLE NAMES. Specify any necessary conditions based on the database schema. Present the rule clearly, indicating both the equivalence and the conditions under which it holds.



Example Equivalence Rules:

<Rule1>
Equivalent Queries:
SELECT ... FROM table WHERE condition1 AND condition2;
SELECT ... FROM table WHERE condition2 AND condition1;
Schema Conditions:
None.
</Rule1>

<Rule2>
Equivalent Queries:
SELECT (SUM(CASE WHEN condition1 THEN expr1 ELSE 0 END) * 1.0 - SUM(CASE WHEN condition2 THEN expr2 ELSE 0 END)) * 100 / SUM(CASE WHEN condition2 THEN expr2 ELSE 0 END) FROM table1 INNER JOIN table2 ON table1.col1 = table2.col1;
SELECT CAST((SUM(CASE WHEN condition1 THEN expr1 ELSE 0 END) - SUM(CASE WHEN condition2 THEN expr2 ELSE 0 END)) AS REAL) * 100 / SUM(CASE WHEN condition2 THEN expr2 ELSE 0 END) FROM table1 INNER JOIN table2 ON table1.col1 = table2.col1;
Schema Conditions:
None.
</Rule2>

<Rule3>
Equivalent Queries:
SELECT COUNT(primary_key_col) FROM table WHERE condition1 AND column = (SELECT MAX(column) FROM table);
SELECT COUNT(foreign_key_col) FROM table WHERE condition1 AND column = (SELECT MAX(column) FROM table);
Schema Conditions:
foreign_key_col is a non-nullable foreign key.
</Rule3>

<Rule4>
Equivalent Queries:
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM table1 INNER JOIN table2 ON table1.col1 = table2.col2 WHERE condition;
SELECT COUNT(table1.col1) FROM table2 INNER JOIN table1 ON table2.col2 = table1.col1 WHERE condition;
Schema Conditions:
table1.col1 is a non-nullable column that uniquely identifies rows in table1.
</Rule4>

<Rule5>
Equivalent Queries:
SELECT SUM(IIF(condition1, expr1, 0)) - SUM(IIF(condition2, expr2, 0)) FROM table;
SELECT SUM(CASE WHEN condition1 THEN expr1 ELSE 0 END) - SUM(CASE WHEN condition2 THEN expr2 ELSE 0 END) FROM table;
Schema Conditions:
None.
</Rule5>

<Rule6>
Equivalent Queries:
SELECT column_name FROM table_name WHERE SUBSTR(date_column, 1, 7) = 'YYYY-MM';

SELECT ... FROM table1 INNER JOIN table2 ON table1.col1 = table2.col1 WHERE table1.col2 = 'value' AND table2.date_col LIKE 'YYYY%';
Schema Conditions:
table2.date_col is consistently formatted as 'YYYY-MM-DD'.
</Rule8>

Schema Conditions:
table1.col3 is a primary key, and table2.col3 is a foreign key referencing table1.col3.
</Rule9>

<Rule10>

# Guidelines:
- Make SURE complete to every step PERFECTLY without ANY Mistakes
- Follow the Rules I Gave you and Remember to AVOID generating repeated equivalence rules in the examples I gave you.
- Be sure to format your response like the example equivalence rules I gave you.
- Put <New Rule></New Rule> around the new equivalence rule that you think of. Do not use other formatting around the equivalent queries.
- Use GENERALIZED COLUMN AND TABLE NAMES in any EQUIVALENCE RULE YOU WRITE. DO NOT USE THE SAME NAMES IN THE PROVIDED QUERY PAIRS!!!!
- If the two queries are not logically equivalent, say <New Rule> Not equivalent </New Rule>.
- If the new equivalence rule is already repeated in the examples listed, say <New Rule> Rule exists </New Rule>.
- The new rule should be be MINIMAL to CLEARLY demonstrate the highlighted semantic difference. Use ellipses to shorten SQL queries where necessary to achieve this.

Take a Deep Breath and Carefully Follow the Rules, Guides and Examples I gave you. I will tip you $2000 if you do EVERYTHING Perfectly.

INFO:root:model: gpt-4o
INFO:root:prompt: You are an expert SQL engineer with 20+ years of experience. You will be given some SQL equivalence rules conditional on some database schemas. You will then be given a pair of SQL queries, consisting of a gold query and a machine-generated query, and a database schema that defines the context of the queries. 

Your task is to compare the two provided SQL queries on logical equivalence and generate one more equivalence rule in the same format as the provided example equivalence rules.

Please make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please also keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.



Evaluation Criteria:

Logical equivalence - the alignment between the gold SQL query and the machine-generated SQL query. A machine-generated SQL query is logically equivalent to the gold query if these two queries would RETURN THE SAME RESULTS AND IN THE SAME ORDER for ALL POSSIBLE DATABASE INSTANCES that satisfy the provided database schema for these queries. Annotators were asked to penalize machine-generated queries that overlooked edge cases that the gold queries would have caught otherwise.



Evaluation steps:

1. Understand the Database Schema: Identify all tables used in both queries. List all columns referenced, along with their data types and constraints. Determine primary and foreign key relationships. Note any indexes or unique constraints that may affect query execution.
2. Parse and Break Down Each Query: Identify selected columns, functions, and expressions. Note the tables involved and the join conditions. Understand the filtering conditions applied. Identify grouping and aggregate conditions, if any. Determine if result ordering affects equivalence.
3. Compare Query Components: Check if both queries use the same tables and join conditions. Compare filtering conditions in the WHERE clauses. Assess whether the same columns and expressions are selected. Identify if different functions or syntaxes achieve the same result. Look for logical equivalence in expressions and calculations.
4. Consider Edge Cases and Data Variations: Conceptualize sample datasets that include edge cases (e.g., NULL values, zero values, special characters). Analyze how each query handles these edge cases. Ensure that data type differences do not affect the outcome. Verify that constraints (e.g., NOT NULL, UNIQUE) are accounted for.
5. Evaluate Aggregations and Calculations: Confirm that aggregate functions (e.g., SUM, COUNT) are applied identically. Ensure calculations (e.g., subtraction, addition) produce the same results.
6. Check for Logical Equivalence in Conditional Expressions: Compare conditional expressions like IIF, CASE WHEN, and IF. Determine if conditions and returned values are logically the same.
7. Assess Ordering of Results: If ORDER BY clause is present, confirm that both queries order results identically. Recognize that differing order may affect equivalence if result order is significant.
8. Generate a New Logical Equivalence Rule (If Applicable): Create an "Equivalent Queries: <query1>
<query2>
Schema Conditions:<conditions>" statement that defines the equivalence. Use GENERALIZED COLUMN and TABLE NAMES. Specify any necessary conditions based on the database schema. Present the rule clearly, indicating both the equivalence and the conditions under which it holds.

SELECT ... FROM table WHERE condition1 AND condition2;
SELECT ... FROM table WHERE condition2 AND condition1;

# Guidelines:
- Make SURE complete to every step PERFECTLY without ANY Mistakes
- Follow the Rules I Gave you and Remember to AVOID generating repeated equivalence rules in the examples I gave you.
- Be sure to format your response like the example equivalence rules I gave you.
- Put <New Rule></New Rule> around the new equivalence rule that you think of. Do not use other formatting around the equivalent queries.
- Use GENERALIZED COLUMN AND TABLE NAMES in any EQUIVALENCE RULE YOU WRITE. DO NOT USE THE SAME NAMES IN THE PROVIDED QUERY PAIRS!!!!
- If the two queries are not logically equivalent, say <New Rule> Not equivalent </New Rule>.
- If the new equivalence rule is already repeated in the examples listed, say <New Rule> Rule exists </New Rule>.
- The new rule should be be MINIMAL to CLEARLY demonstrate the highlighted semantic difference. Use ellipses to shorten SQL queries where necessary to achieve this.

Take a Deep Breath and Carefully Follow the Rules, Guides and Examples I gave you. I will tip you $2000 if you do EVERYTHING Perfectly.

INFO:root:model: gpt-4o
INFO:root:prompt: You are an expert SQL engineer with 20+ years of experience. You will be given some SQL equivalence rules conditional on some database schemas. You will then be given a pair of SQL queries, consisting of a gold query and a machine-generated query, and a database schema that defines the context of the queries. 

Your task is to compare the two provided SQL queries on logical equivalence and generate one more equivalence rule in the same format as the provided example equivalence rules.

Please make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please also keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.



Evaluation Criteria:

Logical equivalence - the alignment between the gold SQL query and the machine-generated SQL query. A machine-generated SQL query is logically equivalent to the gold query if these two queries would RETURN THE SAME RESULTS AND IN THE SAME ORDER for ALL POSSIBLE DATABASE INSTANCES that satisfy the provided database schema for these queries. Annotators were asked to penalize machine-generated queries that overlooked edge cases that the gold queries would have caught otherwise.



Evaluation steps:

1. Understand the Database Schema: Identify all tables used in both queries. List all columns referenced, along with their data types and constraints. Determine primary and foreign key relationships. Note any indexes or unique constraints that may affect query execution.
2. Parse and Break Down Each Query: Identify selected columns, functions, and expressions. Note the tables involved and the join conditions. Understand the filtering conditions applied. Identify grouping and aggregate conditions, if any. Determine if result ordering affects equivalence.
3. Compare Query Components: Check if both queries use the same tables and join conditions. Compare filtering conditions in the WHERE clauses. Assess whether the same columns and expressions are selected. Identify if different functions or syntaxes achieve the same result. Look for logical equivalence in expressions and calculations.
4. Consider Edge Cases and Data Variations: Conceptualize sample datasets that include edge cases (e.g., NULL values, zero values, special characters). Analyze how each query handles these edge cases. Ensure that data type differences do not affect the outcome. Verify that constraints (e.g., NOT NULL, UNIQUE) are accounted for.
5. Evaluate Aggregations and Calculations: Confirm that aggregate functions (e.g., SUM, COUNT) are applied identically. Ensure calculations (e.g., subtraction, addition) produce the same results.
6. Check for Logical Equivalence in Conditional Expressions: Compare conditional expressions like IIF, CASE WHEN, and IF. Determine if conditions and returned values are logically the same.
7. Assess Ordering of Results: If ORDER BY clause is present, confirm that both queries order results identically. Recognize that differing order may affect equivalence if result order is significant.
8. Generate a New Logical Equivalence Rule (If Applicable): Create an "Equivalent Queries: <query1>
<query2>
Schema Conditions:<conditions>" statement that defines the equivalence. Use GENERALIZED COLUMN and TABLE NAMES. Specify any necessary conditions based on the database schema. Present the rule clearly, indicating both the equivalence and the conditions under which it holds.



Example Equivalence Rules:

<Rule1>
Equivalent Queries:
SELECT CAST(SUM(IIF(condition, 1, 0)) AS FLOAT) / SUM(IIF(condition, 1, 0)) FROM table;
SELECT CAST(SUM(CASE WHEN condition THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS REAL) / SUM(CASE WHEN condition THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) FROM table;
Schema Conditions:
None.
</Rule1>

<Rule2>
Equivalent Queries:
SELECT CAST(SUM(IIF(condition, 1, 0)) AS FLOAT) * 100 / COUNT(column) FROM table1 INNER JOIN table2 ON table1.col1 = table2.col1 WHERE table1.date_col = 'date_value';
SELECT CAST(SUM(CASE WHEN condition THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS REAL) * 100 / COUNT(column) FROM table2 INNER JOIN table1 ON table2.col1 = table1.col1 WHERE table1.date_col = 'date_value';
Schema Conditions:
table1.col1 is a foreign key referencing table2.col1, and table2.col1 is a primary key.
</Rule2>

<Rule3>
Equivalent Queries:
SELECT SUM(IIF(condition1, expr1, 0)) - SUM(IIF(condition2, expr2, 0)) FROM table;
SELECT SUM(CASE WHEN condition1 THEN expr1 ELSE 0 END) - SUM(CASE WHEN condition2 THEN expr2 ELSE 0 END) FROM table;
Schema Conditions:
None.
</Rule3>

<Rule4>
Equivalent Queries:
SELECT ... FROM table1 INNER JOIN table2 ON table1.col1 = table2.col1 WHERE table1.col2 = 'value' AND strftime('%Y', table2.date_col) = 'YYYY';
SELECT ... FROM table1 INNER JOIN table2 ON table1.col1 = table2.col1 WHERE table1.col2 = 'value' AND table2.date_col LIKE 'YYYY%';
Schema Conditions:
table2.date_col is consistently formatted as 'YYYY-MM-DD'.
</Rule4>

<Rule5>
Equivalent Queries:
SELECT T1.col1, T2.col2 FROM table1 AS T1 INNER JOIN table2 AS T2 ON T1.col3 = T2.col3 WHERE T1.col3 = value;
SELECT table1.col1, table2.col2 FROM table1 INNER JOIN table2 ON table1.col3 = table2.col3 WHERE table1.col3 = value;
Schema Conditions:
table1.col3 is a primary key, and table2.col3 is a foreign key referencing table1.col3.
</Rule5>

<Rule6>
Equivalent Queries:
SELECT ... FROM table WHERE condition1 AND condition2;
SELECT ... FROM table WHERE condition2 AND condition1;
Schema Conditions:
None.
</Rule6>

<Rule7>
Equivalent Queries:
SELECT COUNT(primary_key_col) FROM table WHERE condition1 AND column = (SELECT MAX(column) FROM table);
SELECT COUNT(foreign_key_col) FROM table WHERE condition1 AND column = (SELECT MAX(column) FROM table);
Schema Conditions:
foreign_key_col is a non-nullable foreign key.
</Rule7>

<Rule8>
Equivalent Queries:
SELECT (SUM(CASE WHEN condition1 THEN expr1 ELSE 0 END) * 1.0 - SUM(CASE WHEN condition2 THEN expr2 ELSE 0 END)) * 100 / SUM(CASE WHEN condition2 THEN expr2 ELSE 0 END) FROM table1 INNER JOIN table2 ON table1.col1 = table2.col1;
SELECT CAST((SUM(CASE WHEN condition1 THEN expr1 ELSE 0 END) - SUM(CASE WHEN condition2 THEN expr2 ELSE 0 END)) AS REAL) * 100 / SUM(CASE WHEN condition2 THEN expr2 ELSE 0 END) FROM table1 INNER JOIN table2 ON table1.col1 = table2.col1;
Schema Conditions:
None.
</Rule8>

<Rule9>
Equivalent Queries:
SELECT column_name FROM table_name WHERE SUBSTR(date_column, 1, 7) = 'YYYY-MM';
SELECT column_name FROM table_name WHERE date_column LIKE 'YYYY-MM%';
Schema Conditions:
None.
</Rule9>

<Rule10>
Equivalent Queries:
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM table1 INNER JOIN table2 ON table1.col1 = table2.col2 WHERE condition;
SELECT COUNT(table1.col1) FROM table2 INNER JOIN table1 ON table2.col2 = table1.col1 WHERE condition;
Schema Conditions:
table1.col1 is a non-nullable column that uniquely identifies rows in table1.
</Rule10>

<Rule11>
Equivalent Queries:
SELECT COUNT(table1.col1) FROM table1 INNER JOIN table2 ON table1.col1 = table2.col2 INNER JOIN table3 ON table2.col3 = table3.col4 WHERE table1.condition1 = 'value' AND table3.condition2 = 'value';
SELECT COUNT(table3.col4) FROM table3 INNER JOIN table2 ON table3.col4 = table2.col3 INNER JOIN table1 ON table2.col2 = table1.col1 WHERE table1.condition1 = 'value' AND table3.condition2 = 'value';
Schema Conditions:
table1.col1 is a primary key, table3.col4 is a primary key, and table2.col2 and table2.col3 are foreign keys referencing table1.col1 and table3.col4 respectively.
</Rule11>

<Rule12>
Equivalent Queries:
SELECT T2.col2 FROM table1 AS T1 INNER JOIN table2 AS T2 ON T1.col1 = T2.col1 WHERE T1.col3 = 'value1' AND T1.col4 = 'value2';
SELECT table2.col2 FROM table2 INNER JOIN table1 ON table2.col1 = table1.col1 WHERE table1.col3 = 'value1' AND table1.col4 = 'value2';
Schema Conditions:
table1.col1 is a foreign key referencing table2.col1, and table2.col1 is a primary key.
</Rule12>

<Rule13>
Equivalent Queries:
SELECT CAST(SUM(column1) AS REAL) / COUNT(column2) FROM table1 INNER JOIN table2 ON table1.col1 = table2.col1 WHERE condition;
SELECT AVG(column1) FROM table1 INNER JOIN table2 ON table1.col1 = table2.col1 WHERE condition;
Schema Conditions:
None.
</Rule13>



# Guidelines:
- Make SURE complete to every step PERFECTLY without ANY Mistakes
- Follow the Rules I Gave you and Remember to AVOID generating repeated equivalence rules in the examples I gave you.
- Be sure to format your response like the example equivalence rules I gave you.
- Put <New Rule></New Rule> around the new equivalence rule that you think of. Do not use other formatting around the equivalent queries.
- Use GENERALIZED COLUMN AND TABLE NAMES in any EQUIVALENCE RULE YOU WRITE. DO NOT USE THE SAME NAMES IN THE PROVIDED QUERY PAIRS!!!!
- If the two queries are not logically equivalent, say <New Rule> Not equivalent </New Rule>.
- If the new equivalence rule is already repeated in the examples listed, say <New Rule> Rule exists </New Rule>.
- The new rule should be be MINIMAL to CLEARLY demonstrate the highlighted semantic difference. Use ellipses to shorten SQL queries where necessary to achieve this.

Take a Deep Breath and Carefully Follow the Rules, Guides and Examples I gave you. I will tip you $2000 if you do EVERYTHING Perfectly.



Pair of SQL Queries:
<Gold SQL Query>
SELECT AVG(T2.milliseconds) FROM races AS T1 INNER JOIN lapTimes AS T2 ON T2.raceId = T1.raceId INNER JOIN drivers AS T3 ON T3.driverId = T2.driverId WHERE T3.forename = 'Lewis' AND T3.surname = 'Hamilton' AND T1.year = 2009 AND T1.name = 'Malaysian Grand Prix';
</Gold SQL Query>

<Machine-generated SQL Query>
SELECT avg(laptimes.milliseconds) FROM races INNER JOIN laptimes ON races.raceid = laptimes.raceid INNER JOIN drivers ON laptimes.driverid = drivers.driverid WHERE drivers.forename = 'Lewis' AND drivers.surname = 'Hamilton' AND races.name = 'Malaysian Grand Prix' AND races.year = 2009;

INFO:root:model: gpt-4o
INFO:root:prompt: You are an expert SQL engineer with 20+ years of experience. You will be given some SQL equivalence rules conditional on some database schemas. You will then be given a pair of SQL queries, consisting of a gold query and a machine-generated query, and a database schema that defines the context of the queries. 

Your task is to compare the two provided SQL queries on logical equivalence and generate one more equivalence rule in the same format as the provided example equivalence rules.

Please make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please also keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.



Evaluation Criteria:

Logical equivalence - the alignment between the gold SQL query and the machine-generated SQL query. A machine-generated SQL query is logically equivalent to the gold query if these two queries would RETURN THE SAME RESULTS AND IN THE SAME ORDER for ALL POSSIBLE DATABASE INSTANCES that satisfy the provided database schema for these queries. Annotators were asked to penalize machine-generated queries that overlooked edge cases that the gold queries would have caught otherwise.



Evaluation steps:

1. Understand the Database Schema: Identify all tables used in both queries. List all columns referenced, along with their data types and constraints. Determine primary and foreign key relationships. Note any indexes or unique constraints that may affect query execution.
2. Parse and Break Down Each Query: Identify selected columns, functions, and expressions. Note the tables involved and the join conditions. Understand the filtering conditions applied. Identify grouping and aggregate conditions, if any. Determine if result ordering affects equivalence.
3. Compare Query Components: Check if both queries use the same tables and join conditions. Compare filtering conditions in the WHERE clauses. Assess whether the same columns and expressions are selected. Identify if different functions or syntaxes achieve the same result. Look for logical equivalence in expressions and calculations.
4. Consider Edge Cases and Data Variations: Conceptualize sample datasets that include edge cases (e.g., NULL values, zero values, special characters). Analyze how each query handles these edge cases. Ensure that data type differences do not affect the outcome. Verify that constraints (e.g., NOT NULL, UNIQUE) are accounted for.
5. Evaluate Aggregations and Calculations: Confirm that aggregate functions (e.g., SUM, COUNT) are applied identically. Ensure calculations (e.g., subtraction, addition) produce the same results.
6. Check for Logical Equivalence in Conditional Expressions: Compare conditional expressions like IIF, CASE WHEN, and IF. Determine if conditions and returned values are logically the same.
7. Assess Ordering of Results: If ORDER BY clause is present, confirm that both queries order results identically. Recognize that differing order may affect equivalence if result order is significant.
8. Generate a New Logical Equivalence Rule (If Applicable): Create an "Equivalent Queries: <query1>
<query2>
Schema Conditions:<conditions>" statement that defines the equivalence. Use GENERALIZED COLUMN and TABLE NAMES. Specify any necessary conditions based on the database schema. Present the rule clearly, indicating both the equivalence and the conditions under which it holds.



Example Equivalence Rules:

<Rule1>
Equivalent Queries:
SELECT COUNT(primary_key_col) FROM table WHERE condition1 AND column = (SELECT MAX(column) FROM table);
SELECT COUNT(foreign_key_col) FROM table WHERE condition1 AND column = (SELECT MAX(column) FROM table);
Schema Conditions:
foreign_key_col is a non-nullable foreign key.
</Rule1>

<Rule2>
Equivalent Queries:
SELECT CAST(SUM(IIF(condition, 1, 0)) AS FLOAT) / SUM(IIF(condition, 1, 0)) FROM table;

# Guidelines:
- Make SURE complete to every step PERFECTLY without ANY Mistakes
- Follow the Rules I Gave you and Remember to AVOID generating repeated equivalence rules in the examples I gave you.
- Be sure to format your response like the example equivalence rules I gave you.
- Put <New Rule></New Rule> around the new equivalence rule that you think of. Do not use other formatting around the equivalent queries.
- Use GENERALIZED COLUMN AND TABLE NAMES in any EQUIVALENCE RULE YOU WRITE. DO NOT USE THE SAME NAMES IN THE PROVIDED QUERY PAIRS!!!!
- If the two queries are not logically equivalent, say <New Rule> Not equivalent </New Rule>.
- If the new equivalence rule is already repeated in the examples listed, say <New Rule> Rule exists </New Rule>.
- The new rule should be be MINIMAL to CLEARLY demonstrate the highlighted semantic difference. Use ellipses to shorten SQL queries where necessary to achieve this.

Take a Deep Breath and Carefully Follow the Rules, Guides and Examples I gave you. I will tip you $2000 if you do EVERYTHING Perfectly.

INFO:root:model: gpt-4o
INFO:root:prompt: You are an expert SQL engineer with 20+ years of experience. You will be given some SQL equivalence rules conditional on some database schemas. You will then be given a pair of SQL queries, consisting of a gold query and a machine-generated query, and a database schema that defines the context of the queries. 

Your task is to compare the two provided SQL queries on logical equivalence and generate one more equivalence rule in the same format as the provided example equivalence rules.

Please make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please also keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.



Evaluation Criteria:

Logical equivalence - the alignment between the gold SQL query and the machine-generated SQL query. A machine-generated SQL query is logically equivalent to the gold query if these two queries would RETURN THE SAME RESULTS AND IN THE SAME ORDER for ALL POSSIBLE DATABASE INSTANCES that satisfy the provided database schema for these queries. Annotators were asked to penalize machine-generated queries that overlooked edge cases that the gold queries would have caught otherwise.



Evaluation steps:

1. Understand the Database Schema: Identify all tables used in both queries. List all columns referenced, along with their data types and constraints. Determine primary and foreign key relationships. Note any indexes or unique constraints that may affect query execution.
2. Parse and Break Down Each Query: Identify selected columns, functions, and expressions. Note the tables involved and the join conditions. Understand the filtering conditions applied. Identify grouping and aggregate conditions, if any. Determine if result ordering affects equivalence.
3. Compare Query Components: Check if both queries use the same tables and join conditions. Compare filtering conditions in the WHERE clauses. Assess whether the same columns and expressions are selected. Identify if different functions or syntaxes achieve the same result. Look for logical equivalence in expressions and calculations.
4. Consider Edge Cases and Data Variations: Conceptualize sample datasets that include edge cases (e.g., NULL values, zero values, special characters). Analyze how each query handles these edge cases. Ensure that data type differences do not affect the outcome. Verify that constraints (e.g., NOT NULL, UNIQUE) are accounted for.
5. Evaluate Aggregations and Calculations: Confirm that aggregate functions (e.g., SUM, COUNT) are applied identically. Ensure calculations (e.g., subtraction, addition) produce the same results.
6. Check for Logical Equivalence in Conditional Expressions: Compare conditional expressions like IIF, CASE WHEN, and IF. Determine if conditions and returned values are logically the same.
7. Assess Ordering of Results: If ORDER BY clause is present, confirm that both queries order results identically. Recognize that differing order may affect equivalence if result order is significant.
8. Generate a New Logical Equivalence Rule (If Applicable): Create an "Equivalent Queries: <query1>
<query2>
Schema Conditions:<conditions>" statement that defines the equivalence. Use GENERALIZED COLUMN and TABLE NAMES. Specify any necessary conditions based on the database schema. Present the rule clearly, indicating both the equivalence and the conditions under which it holds.

SELECT ... FROM table WHERE condition1 AND condition2;
SELECT ... FROM table WHERE condition2 AND condition1;
Schema Conditions:

# Guidelines:
- Make SURE complete to every step PERFECTLY without ANY Mistakes
- Follow the Rules I Gave you and Remember to AVOID generating repeated equivalence rules in the examples I gave you.
- Be sure to format your response like the example equivalence rules I gave you.
- Put <New Rule></New Rule> around the new equivalence rule that you think of. Do not use other formatting around the equivalent queries.
- Use GENERALIZED COLUMN AND TABLE NAMES in any EQUIVALENCE RULE YOU WRITE. DO NOT USE THE SAME NAMES IN THE PROVIDED QUERY PAIRS!!!!
- If the two queries are not logically equivalent, say <New Rule> Not equivalent </New Rule>.
- If the new equivalence rule is already repeated in the examples listed, say <New Rule> Rule exists </New Rule>.
- The new rule should be be MINIMAL to CLEARLY demonstrate the highlighted semantic difference. Use ellipses to shorten SQL queries where necessary to achieve this.

Take a Deep Breath and Carefully Follow the Rules, Guides and Examples I gave you. I will tip you $2000 if you do EVERYTHING Perfectly.

INFO:root:model: gpt-4o
INFO:root:prompt: You are an expert SQL engineer with 20+ years of experience. You will be given some SQL equivalence rules conditional on some database schemas. You will then be given a pair of SQL queries, consisting of a gold query and a machine-generated query, and a database schema that defines the context of the queries. 

Your task is to compare the two provided SQL queries on logical equivalence and generate one more equivalence rule in the same format as the provided example equivalence rules.

Please make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please also keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.



Evaluation Criteria:

Logical equivalence - the alignment between the gold SQL query and the machine-generated SQL query. A machine-generated SQL query is logically equivalent to the gold query if these two queries would RETURN THE SAME RESULTS AND IN THE SAME ORDER for ALL POSSIBLE DATABASE INSTANCES that satisfy the provided database schema for these queries. Annotators were asked to penalize machine-generated queries that overlooked edge cases that the gold queries would have caught otherwise.



Evaluation steps:

1. Understand the Database Schema: Identify all tables used in both queries. List all columns referenced, along with their data types and constraints. Determine primary and foreign key relationships. Note any indexes or unique constraints that may affect query execution.
2. Parse and Break Down Each Query: Identify selected columns, functions, and expressions. Note the tables involved and the join conditions. Understand the filtering conditions applied. Identify grouping and aggregate conditions, if any. Determine if result ordering affects equivalence.
3. Compare Query Components: Check if both queries use the same tables and join conditions. Compare filtering conditions in the WHERE clauses. Assess whether the same columns and expressions are selected. Identify if different functions or syntaxes achieve the same result. Look for logical equivalence in expressions and calculations.
4. Consider Edge Cases and Data Variations: Conceptualize sample datasets that include edge cases (e.g., NULL values, zero values, special characters). Analyze how each query handles these edge cases. Ensure that data type differences do not affect the outcome. Verify that constraints (e.g., NOT NULL, UNIQUE) are accounted for.
5. Evaluate Aggregations and Calculations: Confirm that aggregate functions (e.g., SUM, COUNT) are applied identically. Ensure calculations (e.g., subtraction, addition) produce the same results.
6. Check for Logical Equivalence in Conditional Expressions: Compare conditional expressions like IIF, CASE WHEN, and IF. Determine if conditions and returned values are logically the same.
7. Assess Ordering of Results: If ORDER BY clause is present, confirm that both queries order results identically. Recognize that differing order may affect equivalence if result order is significant.
8. Generate a New Logical Equivalence Rule (If Applicable): Create an "Equivalent Queries: <query1>
<query2>
Schema Conditions:<conditions>" statement that defines the equivalence. Use GENERALIZED COLUMN and TABLE NAMES. Specify any necessary conditions based on the database schema. Present the rule clearly, indicating both the equivalence and the conditions under which it holds.



Example Equivalence Rules:

<Rule1>
Equivalent Queries:
SELECT COUNT(table1.col1) FROM table1 INNER JOIN table2 ON table1.col1 = table2.col2 INNER JOIN table3 ON table2.col3 = table3.col4 WHERE table1.condition1 = 'value' AND table3.condition2 = 'value';

- Put <New Rule></New Rule> around the new equivalence rule that you think of. Do not use other formatting around the equivalent queries.
- Use GENERALIZED COLUMN AND TABLE NAMES in any EQUIVALENCE RULE YOU WRITE. DO NOT USE THE SAME NAMES IN THE PROVIDED QUERY PAIRS!!!!
- If the two queries are not logically equivalent, say <New Rule> Not equivalent </New Rule>.
- If the new equivalence rule is already repeated in the examples listed, say <New Rule> Rule exists </New Rule>.
- The new rule should be be MINIMAL to CLEARLY demonstrate the highlighted semantic difference. Use ellipses to shorten SQL queries where necessary to achieve this.

Take a Deep Breath and Carefully Follow the Rules, Guides and Examples I gave you. I will tip you $2000 if you do EVERYTHING Perfectly.

INFO:root:model: gpt-4o
INFO:root:prompt: You are an expert SQL engineer with 20+ years of experience. You will be given some SQL equivalence rules conditional on some database schemas. You will then be given a pair of SQL queries, consisting of a gold query and a machine-generated query, and a database schema that defines the context of the queries. 

Your task is to compare the two provided SQL queries on logical equivalence and generate one more equivalence rule in the same format as the provided example equivalence rules.

Please make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please also keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.



Evaluation Criteria:

Logical equivalence - the alignment between the gold SQL query and the machine-generated SQL query. A machine-generated SQL query is logically equivalent to the gold query if these two queries would RETURN THE SAME RESULTS AND IN THE SAME ORDER for ALL POSSIBLE DATABASE INSTANCES that satisfy the provided database schema for these queries. Annotators were asked to penalize machine-generated queries that overlooked edge cases that the gold queries would have caught otherwise.



Evaluation steps:

1. Understand the Database Schema: Identify all tables used in both queries. List all columns referenced, along with their data types and constraints. Determine primary and foreign key relationships. Note any indexes or unique constraints that may affect query execution.
2. Parse and Break Down Each Query: Identify selected columns, functions, and expressions. Note the tables involved and the join conditions. Understand the filtering conditions applied. Identify grouping and aggregate conditions, if any. Determine if result ordering affects equivalence.
3. Compare Query Components: Check if both queries use the same tables and join conditions. Compare filtering conditions in the WHERE clauses. Assess whether the same columns and expressions are selected. Identify if different functions or syntaxes achieve the same result. Look for logical equivalence in expressions and calculations.
4. Consider Edge Cases and Data Variations: Conceptualize sample datasets that include edge cases (e.g., NULL values, zero values, special characters). Analyze how each query handles these edge cases. Ensure that data type differences do not affect the outcome. Verify that constraints (e.g., NOT NULL, UNIQUE) are accounted for.
5. Evaluate Aggregations and Calculations: Confirm that aggregate functions (e.g., SUM, COUNT) are applied identically. Ensure calculations (e.g., subtraction, addition) produce the same results.
6. Check for Logical Equivalence in Conditional Expressions: Compare conditional expressions like IIF, CASE WHEN, and IF. Determine if conditions and returned values are logically the same.
7. Assess Ordering of Results: If ORDER BY clause is present, confirm that both queries order results identically. Recognize that differing order may affect equivalence if result order is significant.
8. Generate a New Logical Equivalence Rule (If Applicable): Create an "Equivalent Queries: <query1>
<query2>
Schema Conditions:<conditions>" statement that defines the equivalence. Use GENERALIZED COLUMN and TABLE NAMES. Specify any necessary conditions based on the database schema. Present the rule clearly, indicating both the equivalence and the conditions under which it holds.



Example Equivalence Rules:

<Rule1>
Equivalent Queries:
SELECT CAST(COUNT(CASE WHEN t1.col1 = 'value' THEN t2.col2 END) AS REAL) * 100 / COUNT(t2.col2) FROM table1 AS t1 INNER JOIN table2 AS t2 ON t2.col2 = t1.col2 WHERE t2.col3 = 'value';
SELECT CAST(SUM(CASE WHEN table1.col1 = 'value' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS REAL) * 100 / COUNT(table2.col2) FROM table2 INNER JOIN table1 ON table2.col2 = table1.col2 WHERE table2.col3 = 'value';
Schema Conditions:
table2.col2 is a foreign key referencing table1.col2, and table1.col2 is a primary key.
</Rule1>

<Rule2>
Equivalent Queries:
SELECT CAST(SUM(IIF(condition, 1, 0)) AS FLOAT) * 100 / COUNT(column) FROM table1 INNER JOIN table2 ON table1.col1 = table2.col1 WHERE table1.date_col = 'date_value';
SELECT CAST(SUM(CASE WHEN condition THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS REAL) * 100 / COUNT(column) FROM table2 INNER JOIN table1 ON table2.col1 = table1.col1 WHERE table1.date_col = 'date_value';

# Guidelines:
- Make SURE complete to every step PERFECTLY without ANY Mistakes
- Follow the Rules I Gave you and Remember to AVOID generating repeated equivalence rules in the examples I gave you.
- Be sure to format your response like the example equivalence rules I gave you.
- Put <New Rule></New Rule> around the new equivalence rule that you think of. Do not use other formatting around the equivalent queries.
- Use GENERALIZED COLUMN AND TABLE NAMES in any EQUIVALENCE RULE YOU WRITE. DO NOT USE THE SAME NAMES IN THE PROVIDED QUERY PAIRS!!!!
- If the two queries are not logically equivalent, say <New Rule> Not equivalent </New Rule>.
- If the new equivalence rule is already repeated in the examples listed, say <New Rule> Rule exists </New Rule>.
- The new rule should be be MINIMAL to CLEARLY demonstrate the highlighted semantic difference. Use ellipses to shorten SQL queries where necessary to achieve this.

Take a Deep Breath and Carefully Follow the Rules, Guides and Examples I gave you. I will tip you $2000 if you do EVERYTHING Perfectly.

INFO:root:model: gpt-4o
INFO:root:prompt: You are an expert SQL engineer with 20+ years of experience. You will be given some SQL equivalence rules conditional on some database schemas. You will then be given a pair of SQL queries, consisting of a gold query and a machine-generated query, and a database schema that defines the context of the queries. 

Your task is to compare the two provided SQL queries on logical equivalence and generate one more equivalence rule in the same format as the provided example equivalence rules.

Please make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please also keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.



Evaluation Criteria:

Logical equivalence - the alignment between the gold SQL query and the machine-generated SQL query. A machine-generated SQL query is logically equivalent to the gold query if these two queries would RETURN THE SAME RESULTS AND IN THE SAME ORDER for ALL POSSIBLE DATABASE INSTANCES that satisfy the provided database schema for these queries. Annotators were asked to penalize machine-generated queries that overlooked edge cases that the gold queries would have caught otherwise.



Evaluation steps:

1. Understand the Database Schema: Identify all tables used in both queries. List all columns referenced, along with their data types and constraints. Determine primary and foreign key relationships. Note any indexes or unique constraints that may affect query execution.
2. Parse and Break Down Each Query: Identify selected columns, functions, and expressions. Note the tables involved and the join conditions. Understand the filtering conditions applied. Identify grouping and aggregate conditions, if any. Determine if result ordering affects equivalence.
3. Compare Query Components: Check if both queries use the same tables and join conditions. Compare filtering conditions in the WHERE clauses. Assess whether the same columns and expressions are selected. Identify if different functions or syntaxes achieve the same result. Look for logical equivalence in expressions and calculations.
4. Consider Edge Cases and Data Variations: Conceptualize sample datasets that include edge cases (e.g., NULL values, zero values, special characters). Analyze how each query handles these edge cases. Ensure that data type differences do not affect the outcome. Verify that constraints (e.g., NOT NULL, UNIQUE) are accounted for.
5. Evaluate Aggregations and Calculations: Confirm that aggregate functions (e.g., SUM, COUNT) are applied identically. Ensure calculations (e.g., subtraction, addition) produce the same results.
6. Check for Logical Equivalence in Conditional Expressions: Compare conditional expressions like IIF, CASE WHEN, and IF. Determine if conditions and returned values are logically the same.
7. Assess Ordering of Results: If ORDER BY clause is present, confirm that both queries order results identically. Recognize that differing order may affect equivalence if result order is significant.
8. Generate a New Logical Equivalence Rule (If Applicable): Create an "Equivalent Queries: <query1>
<query2>
Schema Conditions:<conditions>" statement that defines the equivalence. Use GENERALIZED COLUMN and TABLE NAMES. Specify any necessary conditions based on the database schema. Present the rule clearly, indicating both the equivalence and the conditions under which it holds.

SELECT CAST(SUM(IIF(condition, 1, 0)) AS FLOAT) / SUM(IIF(condition, 1, 0)) FROM table;

The use of aliases in the gold query does not affect the result set or its order.\n\n### Step 8: Generate a New Logical Equivalence Rule\nThe equivalence observed here is that using table aliases does not affect the logical equivalence of a query.

INFO:root:model: gpt-4o
INFO:root:prompt: You are an expert SQL engineer with 20+ years of experience. You will be given some SQL equivalence rules conditional on some database schemas. You will then be given a pair of SQL queries, consisting of a gold query and a machine-generated query, and a database schema that defines the context of the queries. 

Your task is to compare the two provided SQL queries on logical equivalence and generate one more equivalence rule in the same format as the provided example equivalence rules.

Please make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please also keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.



Evaluation Criteria:

Logical equivalence - the alignment between the gold SQL query and the machine-generated SQL query. A machine-generated SQL query is logically equivalent to the gold query if these two queries would RETURN THE SAME RESULTS AND IN THE SAME ORDER for ALL POSSIBLE DATABASE INSTANCES that satisfy the provided database schema for these queries. Annotators were asked to penalize machine-generated queries that overlooked edge cases that the gold queries would have caught otherwise.



Evaluation steps:

1. Understand the Database Schema: Identify all tables used in both queries. List all columns referenced, along with their data types and constraints. Determine primary and foreign key relationships. Note any indexes or unique constraints that may affect query execution.
2. Parse and Break Down Each Query: Identify selected columns, functions, and expressions. Note the tables involved and the join conditions. Understand the filtering conditions applied. Identify grouping and aggregate conditions, if any. Determine if result ordering affects equivalence.
3. Compare Query Components: Check if both queries use the same tables and join conditions. Compare filtering conditions in the WHERE clauses. Assess whether the same columns and expressions are selected. Identify if different functions or syntaxes achieve the same result. Look for logical equivalence in expressions and calculations.
4. Consider Edge Cases and Data Variations: Conceptualize sample datasets that include edge cases (e.g., NULL values, zero values, special characters). Analyze how each query handles these edge cases. Ensure that data type differences do not affect the outcome. Verify that constraints (e.g., NOT NULL, UNIQUE) are accounted for.
5. Evaluate Aggregations and Calculations: Confirm that aggregate functions (e.g., SUM, COUNT) are applied identically. Ensure calculations (e.g., subtraction, addition) produce the same results.
6. Check for Logical Equivalence in Conditional Expressions: Compare conditional expressions like IIF, CASE WHEN, and IF. Determine if conditions and returned values are logically the same.
7. Assess Ordering of Results: If ORDER BY clause is present, confirm that both queries order results identically. Recognize that differing order may affect equivalence if result order is significant.
8. Generate a New Logical Equivalence Rule (If Applicable): Create an "Equivalent Queries: <query1>
<query2>
Schema Conditions:<conditions>" statement that defines the equivalence. Use GENERALIZED COLUMN and TABLE NAMES. Specify any necessary conditions based on the database schema. Present the rule clearly, indicating both the equivalence and the conditions under which it holds.



Example Equivalence Rules:

# Guidelines:
- Make SURE complete to every step PERFECTLY without ANY Mistakes
- Follow the Rules I Gave you and Remember to AVOID generating repeated equivalence rules in the examples I gave you.
- Be sure to format your response like the example equivalence rules I gave you.
- Put <New Rule></New Rule> around the new equivalence rule that you think of. Do not use other formatting around the equivalent queries.
- Use GENERALIZED COLUMN AND TABLE NAMES in any EQUIVALENCE RULE YOU WRITE. DO NOT USE THE SAME NAMES IN THE PROVIDED QUERY PAIRS!!!!
- If the two queries are not logically equivalent, say <New Rule> Not equivalent </New Rule>.
- If the new equivalence rule is already repeated in the examples listed, say <New Rule> Rule exists </New Rule>.
- The new rule should be be MINIMAL to CLEARLY demonstrate the highlighted semantic difference. Use ellipses to shorten SQL queries where necessary to achieve this.

INFO:root:prompt: You are an expert SQL engineer with 20+ years of experience. You will be given some SQL equivalence rules conditional on some database schemas. You will then be given a pair of SQL queries, consisting of a gold query and a machine-generated query, and a database schema that defines the context of the queries. 

Your task is to compare the two provided SQL queries on logical equivalence and generate one more equivalence rule in the same format as the provided example equivalence rules.

Please make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please also keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.



Evaluation Criteria:

Logical equivalence - the alignment between the gold SQL query and the machine-generated SQL query. A machine-generated SQL query is logically equivalent to the gold query if these two queries would RETURN THE SAME RESULTS AND IN THE SAME ORDER for ALL POSSIBLE DATABASE INSTANCES that satisfy the provided database schema for these queries. Annotators were asked to penalize machine-generated queries that overlooked edge cases that the gold queries would have caught otherwise.



Evaluation steps:

1. Understand the Database Schema: Identify all tables used in both queries. List all columns referenced, along with their data types and constraints. Determine primary and foreign key relationships. Note any indexes or unique constraints that may affect query execution.
2. Parse and Break Down Each Query: Identify selected columns, functions, and expressions. Note the tables involved and the join conditions. Understand the filtering conditions applied. Identify grouping and aggregate conditions, if any. Determine if result ordering affects equivalence.
3. Compare Query Components: Check if both queries use the same tables and join conditions. Compare filtering conditions in the WHERE clauses. Assess whether the same columns and expressions are selected. Identify if different functions or syntaxes achieve the same result. Look for logical equivalence in expressions and calculations.
4. Consider Edge Cases and Data Variations: Conceptualize sample datasets that include edge cases (e.g., NULL values, zero values, special characters). Analyze how each query handles these edge cases. Ensure that data type differences do not affect the outcome. Verify that constraints (e.g., NOT NULL, UNIQUE) are accounted for.
5. Evaluate Aggregations and Calculations: Confirm that aggregate functions (e.g., SUM, COUNT) are applied identically. Ensure calculations (e.g., subtraction, addition) produce the same results.
6. Check for Logical Equivalence in Conditional Expressions: Compare conditional expressions like IIF, CASE WHEN, and IF. Determine if conditions and returned values are logically the same.
7. Assess Ordering of Results: If ORDER BY clause is present, confirm that both queries order results identically. Recognize that differing order may affect equivalence if result order is significant.
8. Generate a New Logical Equivalence Rule (If Applicable): Create an "Equivalent Queries: <query1>
<query2>
Schema Conditions:<conditions>" statement that defines the equivalence. Use GENERALIZED COLUMN and TABLE NAMES. Specify any necessary conditions based on the database schema. Present the rule clearly, indicating both the equivalence and the conditions under which it holds.

# Guidelines:
- Make SURE complete to every step PERFECTLY without ANY Mistakes
- Follow the Rules I Gave you and Remember to AVOID generating repeated equivalence rules in the examples I gave you.
- Be sure to format your response like the example equivalence rules I gave you.
- Put <New Rule></New Rule> around the new equivalence rule that you think of. Do not use other formatting around the equivalent queries.
- Use GENERALIZED COLUMN AND TABLE NAMES in any EQUIVALENCE RULE YOU WRITE. DO NOT USE THE SAME NAMES IN THE PROVIDED QUERY PAIRS!!!!
- If the two queries are not logically equivalent, say <New Rule> Not equivalent </New Rule>.
- If the new equivalence rule is already repeated in the examples listed, say <New Rule> Rule exists </New Rule>.
- The new rule should be be MINIMAL to CLEARLY demonstrate the highlighted semantic difference. Use ellipses to shorten SQL queries where necessary to achieve this.

Take a Deep Breath and Carefully Follow the Rules, Guides and Examples I gave you. I will tip you $2000 if you do EVERYTHING Perfectly.

INFO:root:prompt: You are an expert SQL engineer with 20+ years of experience. You will be given some SQL equivalence rules conditional on some database schemas. You will then be given a pair of SQL queries, consisting of a gold query and a machine-generated query, and a database schema that defines the context of the queries. 

Your task is to compare the two provided SQL queries on logical equivalence and generate one more equivalence rule in the same format as the provided example equivalence rules.

Please make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please also keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.



Evaluation Criteria:

Logical equivalence - the alignment between the gold SQL query and the machine-generated SQL query. A machine-generated SQL query is logically equivalent to the gold query if these two queries would RETURN THE SAME RESULTS AND IN THE SAME ORDER for ALL POSSIBLE DATABASE INSTANCES that satisfy the provided database schema for these queries. Annotators were asked to penalize machine-generated queries that overlooked edge cases that the gold queries would have caught otherwise.



Evaluation steps:

1. Understand the Database Schema: Identify all tables used in both queries. List all columns referenced, along with their data types and constraints. Determine primary and foreign key relationships. Note any indexes or unique constraints that may affect query execution.
2. Parse and Break Down Each Query: Identify selected columns, functions, and expressions. Note the tables involved and the join conditions. Understand the filtering conditions applied. Identify grouping and aggregate conditions, if any. Determine if result ordering affects equivalence.
3. Compare Query Components: Check if both queries use the same tables and join conditions. Compare filtering conditions in the WHERE clauses. Assess whether the same columns and expressions are selected. Identify if different functions or syntaxes achieve the same result. Look for logical equivalence in expressions and calculations.
4. Consider Edge Cases and Data Variations: Conceptualize sample datasets that include edge cases (e.g., NULL values, zero values, special characters). Analyze how each query handles these edge cases. Ensure that data type differences do not affect the outcome. Verify that constraints (e.g., NOT NULL, UNIQUE) are accounted for.
5. Evaluate Aggregations and Calculations: Confirm that aggregate functions (e.g., SUM, COUNT) are applied identically. Ensure calculations (e.g., subtraction, addition) produce the same results.
6. Check for Logical Equivalence in Conditional Expressions: Compare conditional expressions like IIF, CASE WHEN, and IF. Determine if conditions and returned values are logically the same.
7. Assess Ordering of Results: If ORDER BY clause is present, confirm that both queries order results identically. Recognize that differing order may affect equivalence if result order is significant.
8. Generate a New Logical Equivalence Rule (If Applicable): Create an "Equivalent Queries: <query1>
<query2>
Schema Conditions:<conditions>" statement that defines the equivalence. Use GENERALIZED COLUMN and TABLE NAMES. Specify any necessary conditions based on the database schema. Present the rule clearly, indicating both the equivalence and the conditions under which it holds.



Example Equivalence Rules:

<Rule1>
Equivalent Queries:
SELECT CAST(SUM(IIF(condition, 1, 0)) AS FLOAT) * 100 / COUNT(column) FROM table1 INNER JOIN table2 ON table1.col1 = table2.col1 WHERE table1.date_col = 'date_value';

# Guidelines:
- Make SURE complete to every step PERFECTLY without ANY Mistakes
- Follow the Rules I Gave you and Remember to AVOID generating repeated equivalence rules in the examples I gave you.
- Be sure to format your response like the example equivalence rules I gave you.
- Put <New Rule></New Rule> around the new equivalence rule that you think of. Do not use other formatting around the equivalent queries.
- Use GENERALIZED COLUMN AND TABLE NAMES in any EQUIVALENCE RULE YOU WRITE. DO NOT USE THE SAME NAMES IN THE PROVIDED QUERY PAIRS!!!!
- If the two queries are not logically equivalent, say <New Rule> Not equivalent </New Rule>.
- If the new equivalence rule is already repeated in the examples listed, say <New Rule> Rule exists </New Rule>.
- The new rule should be be MINIMAL to CLEARLY demonstrate the highlighted semantic difference. Use ellipses to shorten SQL queries where necessary to achieve this.

Take a Deep Breath and Carefully Follow the Rules, Guides and Examples I gave you. I will tip you $2000 if you do EVERYTHING Perfectly.

3. Compare Query Components: Check if both queries use the same tables and join conditions. Compare filtering conditions in the WHERE clauses. Assess whether the same columns and expressions are selected. Identify if different functions or syntaxes achieve the same result. Look for logical equivalence in expressions and calculations.
4. Consider Edge Cases and Data Variations: Conceptualize sample datasets that include edge cases (e.g., NULL values, zero values, special characters). Analyze how each query handles these edge cases. Ensure that data type differences do not affect the outcome. Verify that constraints (e.g., NOT NULL, UNIQUE) are accounted for.
5. Evaluate Aggregations and Calculations: Confirm that aggregate functions (e.g., SUM, COUNT) are applied identically. Ensure calculations (e.g., subtraction, addition) produce the same results.
6. Check for Logical Equivalence in Conditional Expressions: Compare conditional expressions like IIF, CASE WHEN, and IF. Determine if conditions and returned values are logically the same.
7. Assess Ordering of Results: If ORDER BY clause is present, confirm that both queries order results identically. Recognize that differing order may affect equivalence if result order is significant.
8. Generate a New Logical Equivalence Rule (If Applicable): Create an "Equivalent Queries: <query1>
<query2>
Schema Conditions:<conditions>" statement that defines the equivalence. Use GENERALIZED COLUMN and TABLE NAMES. Specify any necessary conditions based on the database schema. Present the rule clearly, indicating both the equivalence and the conditions under which it holds.

# Guidelines:
- Make SURE complete to every step PERFECTLY without ANY Mistakes
- Follow the Rules I Gave you and Remember to AVOID generating repeated equivalence rules in the examples I gave you.
- Be sure to format your response like the example equivalence rules I gave you.
- Put <New Rule></New Rule> around the new equivalence rule that you think of. Do not use other formatting around the equivalent queries.
- Use GENERALIZED COLUMN AND TABLE NAMES in any EQUIVALENCE RULE YOU WRITE. DO NOT USE THE SAME NAMES IN THE PROVIDED QUERY PAIRS!!!!
- If the two queries are not logically equivalent, say <New Rule> Not equivalent </New Rule>.
- If the new equivalence rule is already repeated in the examples listed, say <New Rule> Rule exists </New Rule>.
- The new rule should be be MINIMAL to CLEARLY demonstrate the highlighted semantic difference. Use ellipses to shorten SQL queries where necessary to achieve this.

Take a Deep Breath and Carefully Follow the Rules, Guides and Examples I gave you. I will tip you $2000 if you do EVERYTHING Perfectly.

INFO:root:prompt: You are an expert SQL engineer with 20+ years of experience. You will be given some SQL equivalence rules conditional on some database schemas. You will then be given a pair of SQL queries, consisting of a gold query and a machine-generated query, and a database schema that defines the context of the queries. 

Your task is to compare the two provided SQL queries on logical equivalence and generate one more equivalence rule in the same format as the provided example equivalence rules.

Please make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please also keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.



Evaluation Criteria:

Logical equivalence - the alignment between the gold SQL query and the machine-generated SQL query. A machine-generated SQL query is logically equivalent to the gold query if these two queries would RETURN THE SAME RESULTS AND IN THE SAME ORDER for ALL POSSIBLE DATABASE INSTANCES that satisfy the provided database schema for these queries. Annotators were asked to penalize machine-generated queries that overlooked edge cases that the gold queries would have caught otherwise.



Evaluation steps:

1. Understand the Database Schema: Identify all tables used in both queries. List all columns referenced, along with their data types and constraints. Determine primary and foreign key relationships. Note any indexes or unique constraints that may affect query execution.
2. Parse and Break Down Each Query: Identify selected columns, functions, and expressions. Note the tables involved and the join conditions. Understand the filtering conditions applied. Identify grouping and aggregate conditions, if any. Determine if result ordering affects equivalence.
3. Compare Query Components: Check if both queries use the same tables and join conditions. Compare filtering conditions in the WHERE clauses. Assess whether the same columns and expressions are selected. Identify if different functions or syntaxes achieve the same result. Look for logical equivalence in expressions and calculations.
4. Consider Edge Cases and Data Variations: Conceptualize sample datasets that include edge cases (e.g., NULL values, zero values, special characters). Analyze how each query handles these edge cases. Ensure that data type differences do not affect the outcome. Verify that constraints (e.g., NOT NULL, UNIQUE) are accounted for.
5. Evaluate Aggregations and Calculations: Confirm that aggregate functions (e.g., SUM, COUNT) are applied identically. Ensure calculations (e.g., subtraction, addition) produce the same results.
6. Check for Logical Equivalence in Conditional Expressions: Compare conditional expressions like IIF, CASE WHEN, and IF. Determine if conditions and returned values are logically the same.
7. Assess Ordering of Results: If ORDER BY clause is present, confirm that both queries order results identically. Recognize that differing order may affect equivalence if result order is significant.
8. Generate a New Logical Equivalence Rule (If Applicable): Create an "Equivalent Queries: <query1>
<query2>
Schema Conditions:<conditions>" statement that defines the equivalence. Use GENERALIZED COLUMN and TABLE NAMES. Specify any necessary conditions based on the database schema. Present the rule clearly, indicating both the equivalence and the conditions under which it holds.

INFO:root:model: gpt-4o
INFO:root:prompt: You are an expert SQL engineer with 20+ years of experience. You will be given some SQL equivalence rules conditional on some database schemas. You will then be given a pair of SQL queries, consisting of a gold query and a machine-generated query, and a database schema that defines the context of the queries. 

Your task is to compare the two provided SQL queries on logical equivalence and generate one more equivalence rule in the same format as the provided example equivalence rules.

Please make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please also keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.



Evaluation Criteria:

Logical equivalence - the alignment between the gold SQL query and the machine-generated SQL query. A machine-generated SQL query is logically equivalent to the gold query if these two queries would RETURN THE SAME RESULTS AND IN THE SAME ORDER for ALL POSSIBLE DATABASE INSTANCES that satisfy the provided database schema for these queries. Annotators were asked to penalize machine-generated queries that overlooked edge cases that the gold queries would have caught otherwise.



Evaluation steps:

1. Understand the Database Schema: Identify all tables used in both queries. List all columns referenced, along with their data types and constraints. Determine primary and foreign key relationships. Note any indexes or unique constraints that may affect query execution.
2. Parse and Break Down Each Query: Identify selected columns, functions, and expressions. Note the tables involved and the join conditions. Understand the filtering conditions applied. Identify grouping and aggregate conditions, if any. Determine if result ordering affects equivalence.
3. Compare Query Components: Check if both queries use the same tables and join conditions. Compare filtering conditions in the WHERE clauses. Assess whether the same columns and expressions are selected. Identify if different functions or syntaxes achieve the same result. Look for logical equivalence in expressions and calculations.
4. Consider Edge Cases and Data Variations: Conceptualize sample datasets that include edge cases (e.g., NULL values, zero values, special characters). Analyze how each query handles these edge cases. Ensure that data type differences do not affect the outcome. Verify that constraints (e.g., NOT NULL, UNIQUE) are accounted for.
5. Evaluate Aggregations and Calculations: Confirm that aggregate functions (e.g., SUM, COUNT) are applied identically. Ensure calculations (e.g., subtraction, addition) produce the same results.
6. Check for Logical Equivalence in Conditional Expressions: Compare conditional expressions like IIF, CASE WHEN, and IF. Determine if conditions and returned values are logically the same.
7. Assess Ordering of Results: If ORDER BY clause is present, confirm that both queries order results identically. Recognize that differing order may affect equivalence if result order is significant.
8. Generate a New Logical Equivalence Rule (If Applicable): Create an "Equivalent Queries: <query1>
<query2>
Schema Conditions:<conditions>" statement that defines the equivalence. Use GENERALIZED COLUMN and TABLE NAMES. Specify any necessary conditions based on the database schema. Present the rule clearly, indicating both the equivalence and the conditions under which it holds.

SELECT ... FROM table1 INNER JOIN table2 ON table1.col1 = table2.col1 WHERE table1.col2 = 'value' AND strftime('%Y', table2.date_col) = 'YYYY';

INFO:root:prompt: You are an expert SQL engineer with 20+ years of experience. You will be given some SQL equivalence rules conditional on some database schemas. You will then be given a pair of SQL queries, consisting of a gold query and a machine-generated query, and a database schema that defines the context of the queries. 

Your task is to compare the two provided SQL queries on logical equivalence and generate one more equivalence rule in the same format as the provided example equivalence rules.

Please make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please also keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.



Evaluation Criteria:

Logical equivalence - the alignment between the gold SQL query and the machine-generated SQL query. A machine-generated SQL query is logically equivalent to the gold query if these two queries would RETURN THE SAME RESULTS AND IN THE SAME ORDER for ALL POSSIBLE DATABASE INSTANCES that satisfy the provided database schema for these queries. Annotators were asked to penalize machine-generated queries that overlooked edge cases that the gold queries would have caught otherwise.



Evaluation steps:

1. Understand the Database Schema: Identify all tables used in both queries. List all columns referenced, along with their data types and constraints. Determine primary and foreign key relationships. Note any indexes or unique constraints that may affect query execution.
2. Parse and Break Down Each Query: Identify selected columns, functions, and expressions. Note the tables involved and the join conditions. Understand the filtering conditions applied. Identify grouping and aggregate conditions, if any. Determine if result ordering affects equivalence.
3. Compare Query Components: Check if both queries use the same tables and join conditions. Compare filtering conditions in the WHERE clauses. Assess whether the same columns and expressions are selected. Identify if different functions or syntaxes achieve the same result. Look for logical equivalence in expressions and calculations.
4. Consider Edge Cases and Data Variations: Conceptualize sample datasets that include edge cases (e.g., NULL values, zero values, special characters). Analyze how each query handles these edge cases. Ensure that data type differences do not affect the outcome. Verify that constraints (e.g., NOT NULL, UNIQUE) are accounted for.
5. Evaluate Aggregations and Calculations: Confirm that aggregate functions (e.g., SUM, COUNT) are applied identically. Ensure calculations (e.g., subtraction, addition) produce the same results.
6. Check for Logical Equivalence in Conditional Expressions: Compare conditional expressions like IIF, CASE WHEN, and IF. Determine if conditions and returned values are logically the same.
7. Assess Ordering of Results: If ORDER BY clause is present, confirm that both queries order results identically. Recognize that differing order may affect equivalence if result order is significant.
8. Generate a New Logical Equivalence Rule (If Applicable): Create an "Equivalent Queries: <query1>
<query2>
Schema Conditions:<conditions>" statement that defines the equivalence. Use GENERALIZED COLUMN and TABLE NAMES. Specify any necessary conditions based on the database schema. Present the rule clearly, indicating both the equivalence and the conditions under which it holds.

# Guidelines:
- Make SURE complete to every step PERFECTLY without ANY Mistakes
- Follow the Rules I Gave you and Remember to AVOID generating repeated equivalence rules in the examples I gave you.
- Be sure to format your response like the example equivalence rules I gave you.
- Put <New Rule></New Rule> around the new equivalence rule that you think of. Do not use other formatting around the equivalent queries.
- Use GENERALIZED COLUMN AND TABLE NAMES in any EQUIVALENCE RULE YOU WRITE. DO NOT USE THE SAME NAMES IN THE PROVIDED QUERY PAIRS!!!!
- If the two queries are not logically equivalent, say <New Rule> Not equivalent </New Rule>.
- If the new equivalence rule is already repeated in the examples listed, say <New Rule> Rule exists </New Rule>.
- The new rule should be be MINIMAL to CLEARLY demonstrate the highlighted semantic difference. Use ellipses to shorten SQL queries where necessary to achieve this.

Take a Deep Breath and Carefully Follow the Rules, Guides and Examples I gave you. I will tip you $2000 if you do EVERYTHING Perfectly.

INFO:root:prompt: You are an expert SQL engineer with 20+ years of experience. You will be given some SQL equivalence rules conditional on some database schemas. You will then be given a pair of SQL queries, consisting of a gold query and a machine-generated query, and a database schema that defines the context of the queries. 

Your task is to compare the two provided SQL queries on logical equivalence and generate one more equivalence rule in the same format as the provided example equivalence rules.

Please make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please also keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.



Evaluation Criteria:

Logical equivalence - the alignment between the gold SQL query and the machine-generated SQL query. A machine-generated SQL query is logically equivalent to the gold query if these two queries would RETURN THE SAME RESULTS AND IN THE SAME ORDER for ALL POSSIBLE DATABASE INSTANCES that satisfy the provided database schema for these queries. Annotators were asked to penalize machine-generated queries that overlooked edge cases that the gold queries would have caught otherwise.



Evaluation steps:

1. Understand the Database Schema: Identify all tables used in both queries. List all columns referenced, along with their data types and constraints. Determine primary and foreign key relationships. Note any indexes or unique constraints that may affect query execution.
2. Parse and Break Down Each Query: Identify selected columns, functions, and expressions. Note the tables involved and the join conditions. Understand the filtering conditions applied. Identify grouping and aggregate conditions, if any. Determine if result ordering affects equivalence.
3. Compare Query Components: Check if both queries use the same tables and join conditions. Compare filtering conditions in the WHERE clauses. Assess whether the same columns and expressions are selected. Identify if different functions or syntaxes achieve the same result. Look for logical equivalence in expressions and calculations.
4. Consider Edge Cases and Data Variations: Conceptualize sample datasets that include edge cases (e.g., NULL values, zero values, special characters). Analyze how each query handles these edge cases. Ensure that data type differences do not affect the outcome. Verify that constraints (e.g., NOT NULL, UNIQUE) are accounted for.
5. Evaluate Aggregations and Calculations: Confirm that aggregate functions (e.g., SUM, COUNT) are applied identically. Ensure calculations (e.g., subtraction, addition) produce the same results.
6. Check for Logical Equivalence in Conditional Expressions: Compare conditional expressions like IIF, CASE WHEN, and IF. Determine if conditions and returned values are logically the same.
7. Assess Ordering of Results: If ORDER BY clause is present, confirm that both queries order results identically. Recognize that differing order may affect equivalence if result order is significant.
8. Generate a New Logical Equivalence Rule (If Applicable): Create an "Equivalent Queries: <query1>
<query2>
Schema Conditions:<conditions>" statement that defines the equivalence. Use GENERALIZED COLUMN and TABLE NAMES. Specify any necessary conditions based on the database schema. Present the rule clearly, indicating both the equivalence and the conditions under which it holds.



Example Equivalence Rules:

<Rule1>
Equivalent Queries:
SELECT CAST(COUNT(CASE WHEN t1.col1 = 'value' THEN t2.col2 END) AS REAL) * 100 / COUNT(t2.col2) FROM table1 AS t1 INNER JOIN table2 AS t2 ON t2.col2 = t1.col2 WHERE t2.col3 = 'value';
SELECT CAST(SUM(CASE WHEN table1.col1 = 'value' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS REAL) * 100 / COUNT(table2.col2) FROM table2 INNER JOIN table1 ON table2.col2 = table1.col2 WHERE table2.col3 = 'value';

Schema Conditions:
table1.col1 is a primary key, table3.col4 is a primary key, and table2.col2 and table2.col3 are foreign keys referencing table1.col1 and table3.col4 respectively.

# Guidelines:
- Make SURE complete to every step PERFECTLY without ANY Mistakes
- Follow the Rules I Gave you and Remember to AVOID generating repeated equivalence rules in the examples I gave you.
- Be sure to format your response like the example equivalence rules I gave you.
- Put <New Rule></New Rule> around the new equivalence rule that you think of. Do not use other formatting around the equivalent queries.
- Use GENERALIZED COLUMN AND TABLE NAMES in any EQUIVALENCE RULE YOU WRITE. DO NOT USE THE SAME NAMES IN THE PROVIDED QUERY PAIRS!!!!
- If the two queries are not logically equivalent, say <New Rule> Not equivalent </New Rule>.
- If the new equivalence rule is already repeated in the examples listed, say <New Rule> Rule exists </New Rule>.
- The new rule should be be MINIMAL to CLEARLY demonstrate the highlighted semantic difference. Use ellipses to shorten SQL queries where necessary to achieve this.

Take a Deep Breath and Carefully Follow the Rules, Guides and Examples I gave you. I will tip you $2000 if you do EVERYTHING Perfectly.

INFO:root:model: gpt-4o
INFO:root:prompt: You are an expert SQL engineer with 20+ years of experience. You will be given some SQL equivalence rules conditional on some database schemas. You will then be given a pair of SQL queries, consisting of a gold query and a machine-generated query, and a database schema that defines the context of the queries. 

Your task is to compare the two provided SQL queries on logical equivalence and generate one more equivalence rule in the same format as the provided example equivalence rules.

Please make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please also keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.



Evaluation Criteria:

Logical equivalence - the alignment between the gold SQL query and the machine-generated SQL query. A machine-generated SQL query is logically equivalent to the gold query if these two queries would RETURN THE SAME RESULTS AND IN THE SAME ORDER for ALL POSSIBLE DATABASE INSTANCES that satisfy the provided database schema for these queries. Annotators were asked to penalize machine-generated queries that overlooked edge cases that the gold queries would have caught otherwise.



Evaluation steps:

1. Understand the Database Schema: Identify all tables used in both queries. List all columns referenced, along with their data types and constraints. Determine primary and foreign key relationships. Note any indexes or unique constraints that may affect query execution.
2. Parse and Break Down Each Query: Identify selected columns, functions, and expressions. Note the tables involved and the join conditions. Understand the filtering conditions applied. Identify grouping and aggregate conditions, if any. Determine if result ordering affects equivalence.
3. Compare Query Components: Check if both queries use the same tables and join conditions. Compare filtering conditions in the WHERE clauses. Assess whether the same columns and expressions are selected. Identify if different functions or syntaxes achieve the same result. Look for logical equivalence in expressions and calculations.
4. Consider Edge Cases and Data Variations: Conceptualize sample datasets that include edge cases (e.g., NULL values, zero values, special characters). Analyze how each query handles these edge cases. Ensure that data type differences do not affect the outcome. Verify that constraints (e.g., NOT NULL, UNIQUE) are accounted for.
5. Evaluate Aggregations and Calculations: Confirm that aggregate functions (e.g., SUM, COUNT) are applied identically. Ensure calculations (e.g., subtraction, addition) produce the same results.
6. Check for Logical Equivalence in Conditional Expressions: Compare conditional expressions like IIF, CASE WHEN, and IF. Determine if conditions and returned values are logically the same.
7. Assess Ordering of Results: If ORDER BY clause is present, confirm that both queries order results identically. Recognize that differing order may affect equivalence if result order is significant.
8. Generate a New Logical Equivalence Rule (If Applicable): Create an "Equivalent Queries: <query1>
<query2>
Schema Conditions:<conditions>" statement that defines the equivalence. Use GENERALIZED COLUMN and TABLE NAMES. Specify any necessary conditions based on the database schema. Present the rule clearly, indicating both the equivalence and the conditions under which it holds.



Example Equivalence Rules:

<Rule1>
Equivalent Queries:
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM table1 INNER JOIN table2 ON table1.col1 = table2.col2 WHERE condition;
SELECT COUNT(table1.col1) FROM table2 INNER JOIN table1 ON table2.col2 = table1.col1 WHERE condition;

This means the order of results is not guaranteed but is identical in both queries.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe two queries are logically equivalent because they produce the same result set for any possible database instance that satisfies the schema.\n\n### Step 8: Generate a New Logical Equivalence Rule\nSince the queries are logically equivalent and the equivalence is not covered by existing rules, we can define a new rule:\n\n<New Rule>\nEquivalent Queries:\nSELECT T3.power_name FROM table1 AS T1 INNER JOIN table2 AS T2 ON T1.id = T2.hero_id INNER JOIN table3 AS T3 ON T3.id = T2.power_id INNER JOIN table4 AS T4 ON T4.id = T1.gender_id WHERE T4.gender = 'value' LIMIT n;\nSELECT table3.power_name FROM table1 INNER JOIN table4 ON table1.gender_id = table4.id INNER JOIN table2 ON table1.id = table2.hero_id INNER JOIN table3 ON table2.power_id = table3.id WHERE table4.gender = 'value' LIMIT n;\nSchema Conditions:\ntable1.id, table2.hero_id, and table3.id are primary keys; table1.gender_id, table2.hero_id, and table2.power_id are foreign keys referencing table4.id, table1.id, and table3.id respectively.\n", role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None, refusal=None))], created=1730777737, model='gpt-4o-2024-08-06', object='chat.completion', system_fingerprint='fp_45cf54deae', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=799, prompt_tokens=2958, total_tokens=3757, prompt_tokens_details={'cached_tokens': 0}, completion_tokens_details={'reasoning_tokens': 0, 'accepted_prediction_tokens': 0, 'rejected_prediction_tokens': 0}))

INFO:root:model: gpt-4o
INFO:root:prompt: You are an expert SQL engineer with 20+ years of experience. You will be given some SQL equivalence rules conditional on some database schemas. You will then be given a pair of SQL queries, consisting of a gold query and a machine-generated query, and a database schema that defines the context of the queries. 

Your task is to compare the two provided SQL queries on logical equivalence and generate one more equivalence rule in the same format as the provided example equivalence rules.

Please make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please also keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.



Evaluation Criteria:

Logical equivalence - the alignment between the gold SQL query and the machine-generated SQL query. A machine-generated SQL query is logically equivalent to the gold query if these two queries would RETURN THE SAME RESULTS AND IN THE SAME ORDER for ALL POSSIBLE DATABASE INSTANCES that satisfy the provided database schema for these queries. Annotators were asked to penalize machine-generated queries that overlooked edge cases that the gold queries would have caught otherwise.



Evaluation steps:

1. Understand the Database Schema: Identify all tables used in both queries. List all columns referenced, along with their data types and constraints. Determine primary and foreign key relationships. Note any indexes or unique constraints that may affect query execution.
2. Parse and Break Down Each Query: Identify selected columns, functions, and expressions. Note the tables involved and the join conditions. Understand the filtering conditions applied. Identify grouping and aggregate conditions, if any. Determine if result ordering affects equivalence.
3. Compare Query Components: Check if both queries use the same tables and join conditions. Compare filtering conditions in the WHERE clauses. Assess whether the same columns and expressions are selected. Identify if different functions or syntaxes achieve the same result. Look for logical equivalence in expressions and calculations.
4. Consider Edge Cases and Data Variations: Conceptualize sample datasets that include edge cases (e.g., NULL values, zero values, special characters). Analyze how each query handles these edge cases. Ensure that data type differences do not affect the outcome. Verify that constraints (e.g., NOT NULL, UNIQUE) are accounted for.
5. Evaluate Aggregations and Calculations: Confirm that aggregate functions (e.g., SUM, COUNT) are applied identically. Ensure calculations (e.g., subtraction, addition) produce the same results.
6. Check for Logical Equivalence in Conditional Expressions: Compare conditional expressions like IIF, CASE WHEN, and IF. Determine if conditions and returned values are logically the same.
7. Assess Ordering of Results: If ORDER BY clause is present, confirm that both queries order results identically. Recognize that differing order may affect equivalence if result order is significant.
8. Generate a New Logical Equivalence Rule (If Applicable): Create an "Equivalent Queries: <query1>
<query2>
Schema Conditions:<conditions>" statement that defines the equivalence. Use GENERALIZED COLUMN and TABLE NAMES. Specify any necessary conditions based on the database schema. Present the rule clearly, indicating both the equivalence and the conditions under which it holds.

# Guidelines:
- Make SURE complete to every step PERFECTLY without ANY Mistakes
- Follow the Rules I Gave you and Remember to AVOID generating repeated equivalence rules in the examples I gave you.
- Be sure to format your response like the example equivalence rules I gave you.
- Put <New Rule></New Rule> around the new equivalence rule that you think of. Do not use other formatting around the equivalent queries.
- Use GENERALIZED COLUMN AND TABLE NAMES in any EQUIVALENCE RULE YOU WRITE. DO NOT USE THE SAME NAMES IN THE PROVIDED QUERY PAIRS!!!!
- If the two queries are not logically equivalent, say <New Rule> Not equivalent </New Rule>.
- If the new equivalence rule is already repeated in the examples listed, say <New Rule> Rule exists </New Rule>.
- The new rule should be be MINIMAL to CLEARLY demonstrate the highlighted semantic difference. Use ellipses to shorten SQL queries where necessary to achieve this.

Take a Deep Breath and Carefully Follow the Rules, Guides and Examples I gave you. I will tip you $2000 if you do EVERYTHING Perfectly.

INFO:root:prompt: You are an expert SQL engineer with 20+ years of experience. You will be given some SQL equivalence rules conditional on some database schemas. You will then be given a pair of SQL queries, consisting of a gold query and a machine-generated query, and a database schema that defines the context of the queries. 

Your task is to compare the two provided SQL queries on logical equivalence and generate one more equivalence rule in the same format as the provided example equivalence rules.

Please make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please also keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.



Evaluation Criteria:

Logical equivalence - the alignment between the gold SQL query and the machine-generated SQL query. A machine-generated SQL query is logically equivalent to the gold query if these two queries would RETURN THE SAME RESULTS AND IN THE SAME ORDER for ALL POSSIBLE DATABASE INSTANCES that satisfy the provided database schema for these queries. Annotators were asked to penalize machine-generated queries that overlooked edge cases that the gold queries would have caught otherwise.



Evaluation steps:

1. Understand the Database Schema: Identify all tables used in both queries. List all columns referenced, along with their data types and constraints. Determine primary and foreign key relationships. Note any indexes or unique constraints that may affect query execution.
2. Parse and Break Down Each Query: Identify selected columns, functions, and expressions. Note the tables involved and the join conditions. Understand the filtering conditions applied. Identify grouping and aggregate conditions, if any. Determine if result ordering affects equivalence.
3. Compare Query Components: Check if both queries use the same tables and join conditions. Compare filtering conditions in the WHERE clauses. Assess whether the same columns and expressions are selected. Identify if different functions or syntaxes achieve the same result. Look for logical equivalence in expressions and calculations.
4. Consider Edge Cases and Data Variations: Conceptualize sample datasets that include edge cases (e.g., NULL values, zero values, special characters). Analyze how each query handles these edge cases. Ensure that data type differences do not affect the outcome. Verify that constraints (e.g., NOT NULL, UNIQUE) are accounted for.
5. Evaluate Aggregations and Calculations: Confirm that aggregate functions (e.g., SUM, COUNT) are applied identically. Ensure calculations (e.g., subtraction, addition) produce the same results.
6. Check for Logical Equivalence in Conditional Expressions: Compare conditional expressions like IIF, CASE WHEN, and IF. Determine if conditions and returned values are logically the same.
7. Assess Ordering of Results: If ORDER BY clause is present, confirm that both queries order results identically. Recognize that differing order may affect equivalence if result order is significant.
8. Generate a New Logical Equivalence Rule (If Applicable): Create an "Equivalent Queries: <query1>
<query2>
Schema Conditions:<conditions>" statement that defines the equivalence. Use GENERALIZED COLUMN and TABLE NAMES. Specify any necessary conditions based on the database schema. Present the rule clearly, indicating both the equivalence and the conditions under which it holds.

# Guidelines:
- Make SURE complete to every step PERFECTLY without ANY Mistakes
- Follow the Rules I Gave you and Remember to AVOID generating repeated equivalence rules in the examples I gave you.
- Be sure to format your response like the example equivalence rules I gave you.
- Put <New Rule></New Rule> around the new equivalence rule that you think of. Do not use other formatting around the equivalent queries.
- Use GENERALIZED COLUMN AND TABLE NAMES in any EQUIVALENCE RULE YOU WRITE. DO NOT USE THE SAME NAMES IN THE PROVIDED QUERY PAIRS!!!!
- If the two queries are not logically equivalent, say <New Rule> Not equivalent </New Rule>.
- If the new equivalence rule is already repeated in the examples listed, say <New Rule> Rule exists </New Rule>.
- The new rule should be be MINIMAL to CLEARLY demonstrate the highlighted semantic difference. Use ellipses to shorten SQL queries where necessary to achieve this.

Take a Deep Breath and Carefully Follow the Rules, Guides and Examples I gave you. I will tip you $2000 if you do EVERYTHING Perfectly.

INFO:root:prompt: You are an expert SQL engineer with 20+ years of experience. You will be given some SQL equivalence rules conditional on some database schemas. You will then be given a pair of SQL queries, consisting of a gold query and a machine-generated query, and a database schema that defines the context of the queries. 

Your task is to compare the two provided SQL queries on logical equivalence and generate one more equivalence rule in the same format as the provided example equivalence rules.

Please make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please also keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.



Evaluation Criteria:

Logical equivalence - the alignment between the gold SQL query and the machine-generated SQL query. A machine-generated SQL query is logically equivalent to the gold query if these two queries would RETURN THE SAME RESULTS AND IN THE SAME ORDER for ALL POSSIBLE DATABASE INSTANCES that satisfy the provided database schema for these queries. Annotators were asked to penalize machine-generated queries that overlooked edge cases that the gold queries would have caught otherwise.



Evaluation steps:

1. Understand the Database Schema: Identify all tables used in both queries. List all columns referenced, along with their data types and constraints. Determine primary and foreign key relationships. Note any indexes or unique constraints that may affect query execution.
2. Parse and Break Down Each Query: Identify selected columns, functions, and expressions. Note the tables involved and the join conditions. Understand the filtering conditions applied. Identify grouping and aggregate conditions, if any. Determine if result ordering affects equivalence.
3. Compare Query Components: Check if both queries use the same tables and join conditions. Compare filtering conditions in the WHERE clauses. Assess whether the same columns and expressions are selected. Identify if different functions or syntaxes achieve the same result. Look for logical equivalence in expressions and calculations.
4. Consider Edge Cases and Data Variations: Conceptualize sample datasets that include edge cases (e.g., NULL values, zero values, special characters). Analyze how each query handles these edge cases. Ensure that data type differences do not affect the outcome. Verify that constraints (e.g., NOT NULL, UNIQUE) are accounted for.
5. Evaluate Aggregations and Calculations: Confirm that aggregate functions (e.g., SUM, COUNT) are applied identically. Ensure calculations (e.g., subtraction, addition) produce the same results.
6. Check for Logical Equivalence in Conditional Expressions: Compare conditional expressions like IIF, CASE WHEN, and IF. Determine if conditions and returned values are logically the same.
7. Assess Ordering of Results: If ORDER BY clause is present, confirm that both queries order results identically. Recognize that differing order may affect equivalence if result order is significant.
8. Generate a New Logical Equivalence Rule (If Applicable): Create an "Equivalent Queries: <query1>
<query2>
Schema Conditions:<conditions>" statement that defines the equivalence. Use GENERALIZED COLUMN and TABLE NAMES. Specify any necessary conditions based on the database schema. Present the rule clearly, indicating both the equivalence and the conditions under which it holds.

# Guidelines:
- Make SURE complete to every step PERFECTLY without ANY Mistakes
- Follow the Rules I Gave you and Remember to AVOID generating repeated equivalence rules in the examples I gave you.
- Be sure to format your response like the example equivalence rules I gave you.
- Put <New Rule></New Rule> around the new equivalence rule that you think of. Do not use other formatting around the equivalent queries.
- Use GENERALIZED COLUMN AND TABLE NAMES in any EQUIVALENCE RULE YOU WRITE. DO NOT USE THE SAME NAMES IN THE PROVIDED QUERY PAIRS!!!!
- If the two queries are not logically equivalent, say <New Rule> Not equivalent </New Rule>.
- If the new equivalence rule is already repeated in the examples listed, say <New Rule> Rule exists </New Rule>.
- The new rule should be be MINIMAL to CLEARLY demonstrate the highlighted semantic difference. Use ellipses to shorten SQL queries where necessary to achieve this.

Take a Deep Breath and Carefully Follow the Rules, Guides and Examples I gave you. I will tip you $2000 if you do EVERYTHING Perfectly.

Thus, the `DISTINCT` keyword may not affect the result.\n\n5. **Evaluate Aggregations and Calculations:**\n\n   - No aggregations or calculations are present in either query.\n\n6. **Check for Logical Equivalence in Conditional Expressions:**\n\n   - There are no conditional expressions beyond the WHERE clause filtering.\n\n7. **Assess Ordering of Results:**\n\n   - Neither query specifies an `ORDER BY` clause, so result order is not a concern.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nGiven that `superpower.id` is a primary key and `power_name` is likely unique for each `id`, the `DISTINCT` keyword in the Gold query does not alter the result set compared to the Machine-generated query.

# Guidelines:
- Make SURE complete to every step PERFECTLY without ANY Mistakes
- Follow the Rules I Gave you and Remember to AVOID generating repeated equivalence rules in the examples I gave you.
- Be sure to format your response like the example equivalence rules I gave you.
- Put <New Rule></New Rule> around the new equivalence rule that you think of. Do not use other formatting around the equivalent queries.
- Use GENERALIZED COLUMN AND TABLE NAMES in any EQUIVALENCE RULE YOU WRITE. DO NOT USE THE SAME NAMES IN THE PROVIDED QUERY PAIRS!!!!
- If the two queries are not logically equivalent, say <New Rule> Not equivalent </New Rule>.
- If the new equivalence rule is already repeated in the examples listed, say <New Rule> Rule exists </New Rule>.
- The new rule should be be MINIMAL to CLEARLY demonstrate the highlighted semantic difference. Use ellipses to shorten SQL queries where necessary to achieve this.

Take a Deep Breath and Carefully Follow the Rules, Guides and Examples I gave you. I will tip you $2000 if you do EVERYTHING Perfectly.

INFO:root:model: gpt-4o
INFO:root:prompt: You are an expert SQL engineer with 20+ years of experience. You will be given some SQL equivalence rules conditional on some database schemas. You will then be given a pair of SQL queries, consisting of a gold query and a machine-generated query, and a database schema that defines the context of the queries. 

Your task is to compare the two provided SQL queries on logical equivalence and generate one more equivalence rule in the same format as the provided example equivalence rules.

Please make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please also keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.



Evaluation Criteria:

Logical equivalence - the alignment between the gold SQL query and the machine-generated SQL query. A machine-generated SQL query is logically equivalent to the gold query if these two queries would RETURN THE SAME RESULTS AND IN THE SAME ORDER for ALL POSSIBLE DATABASE INSTANCES that satisfy the provided database schema for these queries. Annotators were asked to penalize machine-generated queries that overlooked edge cases that the gold queries would have caught otherwise.



Evaluation steps:

1. Understand the Database Schema: Identify all tables used in both queries. List all columns referenced, along with their data types and constraints. Determine primary and foreign key relationships. Note any indexes or unique constraints that may affect query execution.
2. Parse and Break Down Each Query: Identify selected columns, functions, and expressions. Note the tables involved and the join conditions. Understand the filtering conditions applied. Identify grouping and aggregate conditions, if any. Determine if result ordering affects equivalence.
3. Compare Query Components: Check if both queries use the same tables and join conditions. Compare filtering conditions in the WHERE clauses. Assess whether the same columns and expressions are selected. Identify if different functions or syntaxes achieve the same result. Look for logical equivalence in expressions and calculations.
4. Consider Edge Cases and Data Variations: Conceptualize sample datasets that include edge cases (e.g., NULL values, zero values, special characters). Analyze how each query handles these edge cases. Ensure that data type differences do not affect the outcome. Verify that constraints (e.g., NOT NULL, UNIQUE) are accounted for.
5. Evaluate Aggregations and Calculations: Confirm that aggregate functions (e.g., SUM, COUNT) are applied identically. Ensure calculations (e.g., subtraction, addition) produce the same results.
6. Check for Logical Equivalence in Conditional Expressions: Compare conditional expressions like IIF, CASE WHEN, and IF. Determine if conditions and returned values are logically the same.
7. Assess Ordering of Results: If ORDER BY clause is present, confirm that both queries order results identically. Recognize that differing order may affect equivalence if result order is significant.
8. Generate a New Logical Equivalence Rule (If Applicable): Create an "Equivalent Queries: <query1>
<query2>
Schema Conditions:<conditions>" statement that defines the equivalence. Use GENERALIZED COLUMN and TABLE NAMES. Specify any necessary conditions based on the database schema. Present the rule clearly, indicating both the equivalence and the conditions under which it holds.

Understand the Database Schema\n- **Tables Used**: `superhero`, `hero_attribute`, `attribute`, `publisher`.\n- **Columns Referenced**:\n  - `superhero`: `id`, `superhero_name`, `publisher_id`.\n  - `hero_attribute`: `hero_id`, `attribute_id`, `attribute_value`.\n  - `attribute`: `id`, `attribute_name`.\n  - `publisher`: `id`, `publisher_name`.\n- **Primary and Foreign Keys**:\n  - `superhero.id` is a primary key.\n  - `hero_attribute.hero_id` is a foreign key referencing `superhero.id`.\n  - `hero_attribute.attribute_id` is a foreign key referencing `attribute.id`.\n  - `superhero.publisher_id` is a foreign key referencing `publisher.id`.\n  - `attribute.id` and `publisher.id` are primary keys.\n  \n### 2. Parse and Break Down Each Query\n- **Gold SQL Query**:\n  - Selects `superhero_name` from `superhero`.\n  - Joins `superhero` with `hero_attribute`, `attribute`, and `publisher`.\n  - Filters by `publisher_name = 'Dark Horse Comics'` and `attribute_name = 'Durability'`.\n  - Orders by `attribute_value` in descending order and limits to 1 result.\n  \n- **Machine-generated SQL Query**:\n  - Selects `superhero_name` from `superhero`.\n  - Joins `publisher` with `superhero`, `hero_attribute`, and `attribute`.\n  - Filters by `publisher_name = 'Dark Horse Comics'` and `attribute_name = 'Durability'`.\n  - Orders by `attribute_value` in descending order and limits to 1 result.\n\n### 3. Compare Query Components\n- Both queries use the same tables and join conditions.\n- Both queries have identical filtering conditions.\n- The selected columns and expressions are the same.\n- The ordering and limit are identical.\n\n### 4. Consider Edge Cases and Data Variations\n- Both queries handle potential edge cases such as NULL values in the same way due to their identical structure and conditions.\n\n### 5. Evaluate Aggregations and Calculations\n- There are no aggregate functions in these queries.\n\n### 6. Check for Logical Equivalence in Conditional Expressions\n- The conditions in the WHERE clause are logically the same.\n\n### 7. Assess Ordering of Results\n- Both queries order results by `attribute_value` in descending order and limit to 1, ensuring the same result order.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe gold SQL query and the machine-generated SQL query are logically equivalent. The differences in table aliasing and join order do not affect the result due to the commutative property of joins and the use of specific conditions.\n\n### 8.

INFO:root:model: gpt-4o
INFO:root:prompt: You are an expert SQL engineer with 20+ years of experience. You will be given some SQL equivalence rules conditional on some database schemas. You will then be given a pair of SQL queries, consisting of a gold query and a machine-generated query, and a database schema that defines the context of the queries. 

Your task is to compare the two provided SQL queries on logical equivalence and generate one more equivalence rule in the same format as the provided example equivalence rules.

Please make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please also keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.



Evaluation Criteria:

Logical equivalence - the alignment between the gold SQL query and the machine-generated SQL query. A machine-generated SQL query is logically equivalent to the gold query if these two queries would RETURN THE SAME RESULTS AND IN THE SAME ORDER for ALL POSSIBLE DATABASE INSTANCES that satisfy the provided database schema for these queries. Annotators were asked to penalize machine-generated queries that overlooked edge cases that the gold queries would have caught otherwise.



Evaluation steps:

1. Understand the Database Schema: Identify all tables used in both queries. List all columns referenced, along with their data types and constraints. Determine primary and foreign key relationships. Note any indexes or unique constraints that may affect query execution.
2. Parse and Break Down Each Query: Identify selected columns, functions, and expressions. Note the tables involved and the join conditions. Understand the filtering conditions applied. Identify grouping and aggregate conditions, if any. Determine if result ordering affects equivalence.
3. Compare Query Components: Check if both queries use the same tables and join conditions. Compare filtering conditions in the WHERE clauses. Assess whether the same columns and expressions are selected. Identify if different functions or syntaxes achieve the same result. Look for logical equivalence in expressions and calculations.
4. Consider Edge Cases and Data Variations: Conceptualize sample datasets that include edge cases (e.g., NULL values, zero values, special characters). Analyze how each query handles these edge cases. Ensure that data type differences do not affect the outcome. Verify that constraints (e.g., NOT NULL, UNIQUE) are accounted for.
5. Evaluate Aggregations and Calculations: Confirm that aggregate functions (e.g., SUM, COUNT) are applied identically. Ensure calculations (e.g., subtraction, addition) produce the same results.
6. Check for Logical Equivalence in Conditional Expressions: Compare conditional expressions like IIF, CASE WHEN, and IF. Determine if conditions and returned values are logically the same.
7. Assess Ordering of Results: If ORDER BY clause is present, confirm that both queries order results identically. Recognize that differing order may affect equivalence if result order is significant.
8. Generate a New Logical Equivalence Rule (If Applicable): Create an "Equivalent Queries: <query1>
<query2>
Schema Conditions:<conditions>" statement that defines the equivalence. Use GENERALIZED COLUMN and TABLE NAMES. Specify any necessary conditions based on the database schema. Present the rule clearly, indicating both the equivalence and the conditions under which it holds.

INFO:root:prompt: You are an expert SQL engineer with 20+ years of experience. You will be given some SQL equivalence rules conditional on some database schemas. You will then be given a pair of SQL queries, consisting of a gold query and a machine-generated query, and a database schema that defines the context of the queries. 

Your task is to compare the two provided SQL queries on logical equivalence and generate one more equivalence rule in the same format as the provided example equivalence rules.

Please make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please also keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.



Evaluation Criteria:

Logical equivalence - the alignment between the gold SQL query and the machine-generated SQL query. A machine-generated SQL query is logically equivalent to the gold query if these two queries would RETURN THE SAME RESULTS AND IN THE SAME ORDER for ALL POSSIBLE DATABASE INSTANCES that satisfy the provided database schema for these queries. Annotators were asked to penalize machine-generated queries that overlooked edge cases that the gold queries would have caught otherwise.



Evaluation steps:

1. Understand the Database Schema: Identify all tables used in both queries. List all columns referenced, along with their data types and constraints. Determine primary and foreign key relationships. Note any indexes or unique constraints that may affect query execution.
2. Parse and Break Down Each Query: Identify selected columns, functions, and expressions. Note the tables involved and the join conditions. Understand the filtering conditions applied. Identify grouping and aggregate conditions, if any. Determine if result ordering affects equivalence.
3. Compare Query Components: Check if both queries use the same tables and join conditions. Compare filtering conditions in the WHERE clauses. Assess whether the same columns and expressions are selected. Identify if different functions or syntaxes achieve the same result. Look for logical equivalence in expressions and calculations.
4. Consider Edge Cases and Data Variations: Conceptualize sample datasets that include edge cases (e.g., NULL values, zero values, special characters). Analyze how each query handles these edge cases. Ensure that data type differences do not affect the outcome. Verify that constraints (e.g., NOT NULL, UNIQUE) are accounted for.
5. Evaluate Aggregations and Calculations: Confirm that aggregate functions (e.g., SUM, COUNT) are applied identically. Ensure calculations (e.g., subtraction, addition) produce the same results.
6. Check for Logical Equivalence in Conditional Expressions: Compare conditional expressions like IIF, CASE WHEN, and IF. Determine if conditions and returned values are logically the same.
7. Assess Ordering of Results: If ORDER BY clause is present, confirm that both queries order results identically. Recognize that differing order may affect equivalence if result order is significant.
8. Generate a New Logical Equivalence Rule (If Applicable): Create an "Equivalent Queries: <query1>
<query2>
Schema Conditions:<conditions>" statement that defines the equivalence. Use GENERALIZED COLUMN and TABLE NAMES. Specify any necessary conditions based on the database schema. Present the rule clearly, indicating both the equivalence and the conditions under which it holds.

# Guidelines:
- Make SURE complete to every step PERFECTLY without ANY Mistakes
- Follow the Rules I Gave you and Remember to AVOID generating repeated equivalence rules in the examples I gave you.
- Be sure to format your response like the example equivalence rules I gave you.
- Put <New Rule></New Rule> around the new equivalence rule that you think of. Do not use other formatting around the equivalent queries.
- Use GENERALIZED COLUMN AND TABLE NAMES in any EQUIVALENCE RULE YOU WRITE. DO NOT USE THE SAME NAMES IN THE PROVIDED QUERY PAIRS!!!!
- If the two queries are not logically equivalent, say <New Rule> Not equivalent </New Rule>.
- If the new equivalence rule is already repeated in the examples listed, say <New Rule> Rule exists </New Rule>.
- The new rule should be be MINIMAL to CLEARLY demonstrate the highlighted semantic difference. Use ellipses to shorten SQL queries where necessary to achieve this.

Take a Deep Breath and Carefully Follow the Rules, Guides and Examples I gave you. I will tip you $2000 if you do EVERYTHING Perfectly.

INFO:root:prompt: You are an expert SQL engineer with 20+ years of experience. You will be given some SQL equivalence rules conditional on some database schemas. You will then be given a pair of SQL queries, consisting of a gold query and a machine-generated query, and a database schema that defines the context of the queries. 

Your task is to compare the two provided SQL queries on logical equivalence and generate one more equivalence rule in the same format as the provided example equivalence rules.

Please make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please also keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.



Evaluation Criteria:

Logical equivalence - the alignment between the gold SQL query and the machine-generated SQL query. A machine-generated SQL query is logically equivalent to the gold query if these two queries would RETURN THE SAME RESULTS AND IN THE SAME ORDER for ALL POSSIBLE DATABASE INSTANCES that satisfy the provided database schema for these queries. Annotators were asked to penalize machine-generated queries that overlooked edge cases that the gold queries would have caught otherwise.



Evaluation steps:

1. Understand the Database Schema: Identify all tables used in both queries. List all columns referenced, along with their data types and constraints. Determine primary and foreign key relationships. Note any indexes or unique constraints that may affect query execution.
2. Parse and Break Down Each Query: Identify selected columns, functions, and expressions. Note the tables involved and the join conditions. Understand the filtering conditions applied. Identify grouping and aggregate conditions, if any. Determine if result ordering affects equivalence.
3. Compare Query Components: Check if both queries use the same tables and join conditions. Compare filtering conditions in the WHERE clauses. Assess whether the same columns and expressions are selected. Identify if different functions or syntaxes achieve the same result. Look for logical equivalence in expressions and calculations.
4. Consider Edge Cases and Data Variations: Conceptualize sample datasets that include edge cases (e.g., NULL values, zero values, special characters). Analyze how each query handles these edge cases. Ensure that data type differences do not affect the outcome. Verify that constraints (e.g., NOT NULL, UNIQUE) are accounted for.
5. Evaluate Aggregations and Calculations: Confirm that aggregate functions (e.g., SUM, COUNT) are applied identically. Ensure calculations (e.g., subtraction, addition) produce the same results.
6. Check for Logical Equivalence in Conditional Expressions: Compare conditional expressions like IIF, CASE WHEN, and IF. Determine if conditions and returned values are logically the same.
7. Assess Ordering of Results: If ORDER BY clause is present, confirm that both queries order results identically. Recognize that differing order may affect equivalence if result order is significant.
8. Generate a New Logical Equivalence Rule (If Applicable): Create an "Equivalent Queries: <query1>
<query2>
Schema Conditions:<conditions>" statement that defines the equivalence. Use GENERALIZED COLUMN and TABLE NAMES. Specify any necessary conditions based on the database schema. Present the rule clearly, indicating both the equivalence and the conditions under which it holds.

# Guidelines:
- Make SURE complete to every step PERFECTLY without ANY Mistakes
- Follow the Rules I Gave you and Remember to AVOID generating repeated equivalence rules in the examples I gave you.
- Be sure to format your response like the example equivalence rules I gave you.
- Put <New Rule></New Rule> around the new equivalence rule that you think of. Do not use other formatting around the equivalent queries.
- Use GENERALIZED COLUMN AND TABLE NAMES in any EQUIVALENCE RULE YOU WRITE. DO NOT USE THE SAME NAMES IN THE PROVIDED QUERY PAIRS!!!!
- If the two queries are not logically equivalent, say <New Rule> Not equivalent </New Rule>.
- If the new equivalence rule is already repeated in the examples listed, say <New Rule> Rule exists </New Rule>.
- The new rule should be be MINIMAL to CLEARLY demonstrate the highlighted semantic difference. Use ellipses to shorten SQL queries where necessary to achieve this.

Take a Deep Breath and Carefully Follow the Rules, Guides and Examples I gave you. I will tip you $2000 if you do EVERYTHING Perfectly.

INFO:root:model: gpt-4o
INFO:root:prompt: You are an expert SQL engineer with 20+ years of experience. You will be given some SQL equivalence rules conditional on some database schemas. You will then be given a pair of SQL queries, consisting of a gold query and a machine-generated query, and a database schema that defines the context of the queries. 

Your task is to compare the two provided SQL queries on logical equivalence and generate one more equivalence rule in the same format as the provided example equivalence rules.

Please make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please also keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.



Evaluation Criteria:

Logical equivalence - the alignment between the gold SQL query and the machine-generated SQL query. A machine-generated SQL query is logically equivalent to the gold query if these two queries would RETURN THE SAME RESULTS AND IN THE SAME ORDER for ALL POSSIBLE DATABASE INSTANCES that satisfy the provided database schema for these queries. Annotators were asked to penalize machine-generated queries that overlooked edge cases that the gold queries would have caught otherwise.



Evaluation steps:

1. Understand the Database Schema: Identify all tables used in both queries. List all columns referenced, along with their data types and constraints. Determine primary and foreign key relationships. Note any indexes or unique constraints that may affect query execution.
2. Parse and Break Down Each Query: Identify selected columns, functions, and expressions. Note the tables involved and the join conditions. Understand the filtering conditions applied. Identify grouping and aggregate conditions, if any. Determine if result ordering affects equivalence.
3. Compare Query Components: Check if both queries use the same tables and join conditions. Compare filtering conditions in the WHERE clauses. Assess whether the same columns and expressions are selected. Identify if different functions or syntaxes achieve the same result. Look for logical equivalence in expressions and calculations.
4. Consider Edge Cases and Data Variations: Conceptualize sample datasets that include edge cases (e.g., NULL values, zero values, special characters). Analyze how each query handles these edge cases. Ensure that data type differences do not affect the outcome. Verify that constraints (e.g., NOT NULL, UNIQUE) are accounted for.
5. Evaluate Aggregations and Calculations: Confirm that aggregate functions (e.g., SUM, COUNT) are applied identically. Ensure calculations (e.g., subtraction, addition) produce the same results.
6. Check for Logical Equivalence in Conditional Expressions: Compare conditional expressions like IIF, CASE WHEN, and IF. Determine if conditions and returned values are logically the same.
7. Assess Ordering of Results: If ORDER BY clause is present, confirm that both queries order results identically. Recognize that differing order may affect equivalence if result order is significant.
8. Generate a New Logical Equivalence Rule (If Applicable): Create an "Equivalent Queries: <query1>
<query2>
Schema Conditions:<conditions>" statement that defines the equivalence. Use GENERALIZED COLUMN and TABLE NAMES. Specify any necessary conditions based on the database schema. Present the rule clearly, indicating both the equivalence and the conditions under which it holds.

INFO:root:model: gpt-4o
INFO:root:prompt: You are an expert SQL engineer with 20+ years of experience. You will be given some SQL equivalence rules conditional on some database schemas. You will then be given a pair of SQL queries, consisting of a gold query and a machine-generated query, and a database schema that defines the context of the queries. 

Your task is to compare the two provided SQL queries on logical equivalence and generate one more equivalence rule in the same format as the provided example equivalence rules.

Please make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please also keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.



Evaluation Criteria:

Logical equivalence - the alignment between the gold SQL query and the machine-generated SQL query. A machine-generated SQL query is logically equivalent to the gold query if these two queries would RETURN THE SAME RESULTS AND IN THE SAME ORDER for ALL POSSIBLE DATABASE INSTANCES that satisfy the provided database schema for these queries. Annotators were asked to penalize machine-generated queries that overlooked edge cases that the gold queries would have caught otherwise.



Evaluation steps:

1. Understand the Database Schema: Identify all tables used in both queries. List all columns referenced, along with their data types and constraints. Determine primary and foreign key relationships. Note any indexes or unique constraints that may affect query execution.
2. Parse and Break Down Each Query: Identify selected columns, functions, and expressions. Note the tables involved and the join conditions. Understand the filtering conditions applied. Identify grouping and aggregate conditions, if any. Determine if result ordering affects equivalence.
3. Compare Query Components: Check if both queries use the same tables and join conditions. Compare filtering conditions in the WHERE clauses. Assess whether the same columns and expressions are selected. Identify if different functions or syntaxes achieve the same result. Look for logical equivalence in expressions and calculations.
4. Consider Edge Cases and Data Variations: Conceptualize sample datasets that include edge cases (e.g., NULL values, zero values, special characters). Analyze how each query handles these edge cases. Ensure that data type differences do not affect the outcome. Verify that constraints (e.g., NOT NULL, UNIQUE) are accounted for.
5. Evaluate Aggregations and Calculations: Confirm that aggregate functions (e.g., SUM, COUNT) are applied identically. Ensure calculations (e.g., subtraction, addition) produce the same results.
6. Check for Logical Equivalence in Conditional Expressions: Compare conditional expressions like IIF, CASE WHEN, and IF. Determine if conditions and returned values are logically the same.
7. Assess Ordering of Results: If ORDER BY clause is present, confirm that both queries order results identically. Recognize that differing order may affect equivalence if result order is significant.
8. Generate a New Logical Equivalence Rule (If Applicable): Create an "Equivalent Queries: <query1>
<query2>
Schema Conditions:<conditions>" statement that defines the equivalence. Use GENERALIZED COLUMN and TABLE NAMES. Specify any necessary conditions based on the database schema. Present the rule clearly, indicating both the equivalence and the conditions under which it holds.

# Guidelines:
- Make SURE complete to every step PERFECTLY without ANY Mistakes
- Follow the Rules I Gave you and Remember to AVOID generating repeated equivalence rules in the examples I gave you.
- Be sure to format your response like the example equivalence rules I gave you.
- Put <New Rule></New Rule> around the new equivalence rule that you think of. Do not use other formatting around the equivalent queries.
- Use GENERALIZED COLUMN AND TABLE NAMES in any EQUIVALENCE RULE YOU WRITE. DO NOT USE THE SAME NAMES IN THE PROVIDED QUERY PAIRS!!!!
- If the two queries are not logically equivalent, say <New Rule> Not equivalent </New Rule>.
- If the new equivalence rule is already repeated in the examples listed, say <New Rule> Rule exists </New Rule>.
- The new rule should be be MINIMAL to CLEARLY demonstrate the highlighted semantic difference. Use ellipses to shorten SQL queries where necessary to achieve this.

INFO:root:prompt: You are an expert SQL engineer with 20+ years of experience. You will be given some SQL equivalence rules conditional on some database schemas. You will then be given a pair of SQL queries, consisting of a gold query and a machine-generated query, and a database schema that defines the context of the queries. 

Your task is to compare the two provided SQL queries on logical equivalence and generate one more equivalence rule in the same format as the provided example equivalence rules.

Please make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please also keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.



Evaluation Criteria:

Logical equivalence - the alignment between the gold SQL query and the machine-generated SQL query. A machine-generated SQL query is logically equivalent to the gold query if these two queries would RETURN THE SAME RESULTS AND IN THE SAME ORDER for ALL POSSIBLE DATABASE INSTANCES that satisfy the provided database schema for these queries. Annotators were asked to penalize machine-generated queries that overlooked edge cases that the gold queries would have caught otherwise.



Evaluation steps:

1. Understand the Database Schema: Identify all tables used in both queries. List all columns referenced, along with their data types and constraints. Determine primary and foreign key relationships. Note any indexes or unique constraints that may affect query execution.
2. Parse and Break Down Each Query: Identify selected columns, functions, and expressions. Note the tables involved and the join conditions. Understand the filtering conditions applied. Identify grouping and aggregate conditions, if any. Determine if result ordering affects equivalence.
3. Compare Query Components: Check if both queries use the same tables and join conditions. Compare filtering conditions in the WHERE clauses. Assess whether the same columns and expressions are selected. Identify if different functions or syntaxes achieve the same result. Look for logical equivalence in expressions and calculations.
4. Consider Edge Cases and Data Variations: Conceptualize sample datasets that include edge cases (e.g., NULL values, zero values, special characters). Analyze how each query handles these edge cases. Ensure that data type differences do not affect the outcome. Verify that constraints (e.g., NOT NULL, UNIQUE) are accounted for.
5. Evaluate Aggregations and Calculations: Confirm that aggregate functions (e.g., SUM, COUNT) are applied identically. Ensure calculations (e.g., subtraction, addition) produce the same results.
6. Check for Logical Equivalence in Conditional Expressions: Compare conditional expressions like IIF, CASE WHEN, and IF. Determine if conditions and returned values are logically the same.
7. Assess Ordering of Results: If ORDER BY clause is present, confirm that both queries order results identically. Recognize that differing order may affect equivalence if result order is significant.
8. Generate a New Logical Equivalence Rule (If Applicable): Create an "Equivalent Queries: <query1>
<query2>
Schema Conditions:<conditions>" statement that defines the equivalence. Use GENERALIZED COLUMN and TABLE NAMES. Specify any necessary conditions based on the database schema. Present the rule clearly, indicating both the equivalence and the conditions under which it holds.

# Guidelines:
- Make SURE complete to every step PERFECTLY without ANY Mistakes
- Follow the Rules I Gave you and Remember to AVOID generating repeated equivalence rules in the examples I gave you.
- Be sure to format your response like the example equivalence rules I gave you.
- Put <New Rule></New Rule> around the new equivalence rule that you think of. Do not use other formatting around the equivalent queries.
- Use GENERALIZED COLUMN AND TABLE NAMES in any EQUIVALENCE RULE YOU WRITE. DO NOT USE THE SAME NAMES IN THE PROVIDED QUERY PAIRS!!!!
- If the two queries are not logically equivalent, say <New Rule> Not equivalent </New Rule>.
- If the new equivalence rule is already repeated in the examples listed, say <New Rule> Rule exists </New Rule>.
- The new rule should be be MINIMAL to CLEARLY demonstrate the highlighted semantic difference. Use ellipses to shorten SQL queries where necessary to achieve this.

Take a Deep Breath and Carefully Follow the Rules, Guides and Examples I gave you. I will tip you $2000 if you do EVERYTHING Perfectly.

INFO:root:model: gpt-4o
INFO:root:prompt: You are an expert SQL engineer with 20+ years of experience. You will be given some SQL equivalence rules conditional on some database schemas. You will then be given a pair of SQL queries, consisting of a gold query and a machine-generated query, and a database schema that defines the context of the queries. 

Your task is to compare the two provided SQL queries on logical equivalence and generate one more equivalence rule in the same format as the provided example equivalence rules.

Please make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please also keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.



Evaluation Criteria:

Logical equivalence - the alignment between the gold SQL query and the machine-generated SQL query. A machine-generated SQL query is logically equivalent to the gold query if these two queries would RETURN THE SAME RESULTS AND IN THE SAME ORDER for ALL POSSIBLE DATABASE INSTANCES that satisfy the provided database schema for these queries. Annotators were asked to penalize machine-generated queries that overlooked edge cases that the gold queries would have caught otherwise.



Evaluation steps:

1. Understand the Database Schema: Identify all tables used in both queries. List all columns referenced, along with their data types and constraints. Determine primary and foreign key relationships. Note any indexes or unique constraints that may affect query execution.
2. Parse and Break Down Each Query: Identify selected columns, functions, and expressions. Note the tables involved and the join conditions. Understand the filtering conditions applied. Identify grouping and aggregate conditions, if any. Determine if result ordering affects equivalence.
3. Compare Query Components: Check if both queries use the same tables and join conditions. Compare filtering conditions in the WHERE clauses. Assess whether the same columns and expressions are selected. Identify if different functions or syntaxes achieve the same result. Look for logical equivalence in expressions and calculations.
4. Consider Edge Cases and Data Variations: Conceptualize sample datasets that include edge cases (e.g., NULL values, zero values, special characters). Analyze how each query handles these edge cases. Ensure that data type differences do not affect the outcome. Verify that constraints (e.g., NOT NULL, UNIQUE) are accounted for.
5. Evaluate Aggregations and Calculations: Confirm that aggregate functions (e.g., SUM, COUNT) are applied identically. Ensure calculations (e.g., subtraction, addition) produce the same results.
6. Check for Logical Equivalence in Conditional Expressions: Compare conditional expressions like IIF, CASE WHEN, and IF. Determine if conditions and returned values are logically the same.
7. Assess Ordering of Results: If ORDER BY clause is present, confirm that both queries order results identically. Recognize that differing order may affect equivalence if result order is significant.
8. Generate a New Logical Equivalence Rule (If Applicable): Create an "Equivalent Queries: <query1>
<query2>
Schema Conditions:<conditions>" statement that defines the equivalence. Use GENERALIZED COLUMN and TABLE NAMES. Specify any necessary conditions based on the database schema. Present the rule clearly, indicating both the equivalence and the conditions under which it holds.



Example Equivalence Rules:

# Guidelines:
- Make SURE complete to every step PERFECTLY without ANY Mistakes
- Follow the Rules I Gave you and Remember to AVOID generating repeated equivalence rules in the examples I gave you.
- Be sure to format your response like the example equivalence rules I gave you.
- Put <New Rule></New Rule> around the new equivalence rule that you think of. Do not use other formatting around the equivalent queries.
- Use GENERALIZED COLUMN AND TABLE NAMES in any EQUIVALENCE RULE YOU WRITE. DO NOT USE THE SAME NAMES IN THE PROVIDED QUERY PAIRS!!!!
- If the two queries are not logically equivalent, say <New Rule> Not equivalent </New Rule>.
- If the new equivalence rule is already repeated in the examples listed, say <New Rule> Rule exists </New Rule>.
- The new rule should be be MINIMAL to CLEARLY demonstrate the highlighted semantic difference. Use ellipses to shorten SQL queries where necessary to achieve this.

Take a Deep Breath and Carefully Follow the Rules, Guides and Examples I gave you. I will tip you $2000 if you do EVERYTHING Perfectly.

2. Parse and Break Down Each Query: Identify selected columns, functions, and expressions. Note the tables involved and the join conditions. Understand the filtering conditions applied. Identify grouping and aggregate conditions, if any. Determine if result ordering affects equivalence.
3. Compare Query Components: Check if both queries use the same tables and join conditions. Compare filtering conditions in the WHERE clauses. Assess whether the same columns and expressions are selected. Identify if different functions or syntaxes achieve the same result. Look for logical equivalence in expressions and calculations.
4. Consider Edge Cases and Data Variations: Conceptualize sample datasets that include edge cases (e.g., NULL values, zero values, special characters). Analyze how each query handles these edge cases. Ensure that data type differences do not affect the outcome. Verify that constraints (e.g., NOT NULL, UNIQUE) are accounted for.
5. Evaluate Aggregations and Calculations: Confirm that aggregate functions (e.g., SUM, COUNT) are applied identically. Ensure calculations (e.g., subtraction, addition) produce the same results.
6. Check for Logical Equivalence in Conditional Expressions: Compare conditional expressions like IIF, CASE WHEN, and IF. Determine if conditions and returned values are logically the same.
7. Assess Ordering of Results: If ORDER BY clause is present, confirm that both queries order results identically. Recognize that differing order may affect equivalence if result order is significant.
8. Generate a New Logical Equivalence Rule (If Applicable): Create an "Equivalent Queries: <query1>
<query2>
Schema Conditions:<conditions>" statement that defines the equivalence. Use GENERALIZED COLUMN and TABLE NAMES. Specify any necessary conditions based on the database schema. Present the rule clearly, indicating both the equivalence and the conditions under which it holds.

# Guidelines:
- Make SURE complete to every step PERFECTLY without ANY Mistakes
- Follow the Rules I Gave you and Remember to AVOID generating repeated equivalence rules in the examples I gave you.
- Be sure to format your response like the example equivalence rules I gave you.
- Put <New Rule></New Rule> around the new equivalence rule that you think of. Do not use other formatting around the equivalent queries.
- Use GENERALIZED COLUMN AND TABLE NAMES in any EQUIVALENCE RULE YOU WRITE. DO NOT USE THE SAME NAMES IN THE PROVIDED QUERY PAIRS!!!!
- If the two queries are not logically equivalent, say <New Rule> Not equivalent </New Rule>.
- If the new equivalence rule is already repeated in the examples listed, say <New Rule> Rule exists </New Rule>.
- The new rule should be be MINIMAL to CLEARLY demonstrate the highlighted semantic difference. Use ellipses to shorten SQL queries where necessary to achieve this.

Take a Deep Breath and Carefully Follow the Rules, Guides and Examples I gave you. I will tip you $2000 if you do EVERYTHING Perfectly.

INFO:root:prompt: You are an expert SQL engineer with 20+ years of experience. You will be given some SQL equivalence rules conditional on some database schemas. You will then be given a pair of SQL queries, consisting of a gold query and a machine-generated query, and a database schema that defines the context of the queries. 

Your task is to compare the two provided SQL queries on logical equivalence and generate one more equivalence rule in the same format as the provided example equivalence rules.

Please make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please also keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.



Evaluation Criteria:

Logical equivalence - the alignment between the gold SQL query and the machine-generated SQL query. A machine-generated SQL query is logically equivalent to the gold query if these two queries would RETURN THE SAME RESULTS AND IN THE SAME ORDER for ALL POSSIBLE DATABASE INSTANCES that satisfy the provided database schema for these queries. Annotators were asked to penalize machine-generated queries that overlooked edge cases that the gold queries would have caught otherwise.



Evaluation steps:

1. Understand the Database Schema: Identify all tables used in both queries. List all columns referenced, along with their data types and constraints. Determine primary and foreign key relationships. Note any indexes or unique constraints that may affect query execution.
2. Parse and Break Down Each Query: Identify selected columns, functions, and expressions. Note the tables involved and the join conditions. Understand the filtering conditions applied. Identify grouping and aggregate conditions, if any. Determine if result ordering affects equivalence.
3. Compare Query Components: Check if both queries use the same tables and join conditions. Compare filtering conditions in the WHERE clauses. Assess whether the same columns and expressions are selected. Identify if different functions or syntaxes achieve the same result. Look for logical equivalence in expressions and calculations.
4. Consider Edge Cases and Data Variations: Conceptualize sample datasets that include edge cases (e.g., NULL values, zero values, special characters). Analyze how each query handles these edge cases. Ensure that data type differences do not affect the outcome. Verify that constraints (e.g., NOT NULL, UNIQUE) are accounted for.
5. Evaluate Aggregations and Calculations: Confirm that aggregate functions (e.g., SUM, COUNT) are applied identically. Ensure calculations (e.g., subtraction, addition) produce the same results.
6. Check for Logical Equivalence in Conditional Expressions: Compare conditional expressions like IIF, CASE WHEN, and IF. Determine if conditions and returned values are logically the same.
7. Assess Ordering of Results: If ORDER BY clause is present, confirm that both queries order results identically. Recognize that differing order may affect equivalence if result order is significant.
8. Generate a New Logical Equivalence Rule (If Applicable): Create an "Equivalent Queries: <query1>
<query2>
Schema Conditions:<conditions>" statement that defines the equivalence. Use GENERALIZED COLUMN and TABLE NAMES. Specify any necessary conditions based on the database schema. Present the rule clearly, indicating both the equivalence and the conditions under which it holds.

INFO:root:model: gpt-4o
INFO:root:prompt: You are an expert SQL engineer with 20+ years of experience. You will be given some SQL equivalence rules conditional on some database schemas. You will then be given a pair of SQL queries, consisting of a gold query and a machine-generated query, and a database schema that defines the context of the queries. 

Your task is to compare the two provided SQL queries on logical equivalence and generate one more equivalence rule in the same format as the provided example equivalence rules.

Please make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please also keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.



Evaluation Criteria:

Logical equivalence - the alignment between the gold SQL query and the machine-generated SQL query. A machine-generated SQL query is logically equivalent to the gold query if these two queries would RETURN THE SAME RESULTS AND IN THE SAME ORDER for ALL POSSIBLE DATABASE INSTANCES that satisfy the provided database schema for these queries. Annotators were asked to penalize machine-generated queries that overlooked edge cases that the gold queries would have caught otherwise.



Evaluation steps:

1. Understand the Database Schema: Identify all tables used in both queries. List all columns referenced, along with their data types and constraints. Determine primary and foreign key relationships. Note any indexes or unique constraints that may affect query execution.
2. Parse and Break Down Each Query: Identify selected columns, functions, and expressions. Note the tables involved and the join conditions. Understand the filtering conditions applied. Identify grouping and aggregate conditions, if any. Determine if result ordering affects equivalence.
3. Compare Query Components: Check if both queries use the same tables and join conditions. Compare filtering conditions in the WHERE clauses. Assess whether the same columns and expressions are selected. Identify if different functions or syntaxes achieve the same result. Look for logical equivalence in expressions and calculations.
4. Consider Edge Cases and Data Variations: Conceptualize sample datasets that include edge cases (e.g., NULL values, zero values, special characters). Analyze how each query handles these edge cases. Ensure that data type differences do not affect the outcome. Verify that constraints (e.g., NOT NULL, UNIQUE) are accounted for.
5. Evaluate Aggregations and Calculations: Confirm that aggregate functions (e.g., SUM, COUNT) are applied identically. Ensure calculations (e.g., subtraction, addition) produce the same results.
6. Check for Logical Equivalence in Conditional Expressions: Compare conditional expressions like IIF, CASE WHEN, and IF. Determine if conditions and returned values are logically the same.
7. Assess Ordering of Results: If ORDER BY clause is present, confirm that both queries order results identically. Recognize that differing order may affect equivalence if result order is significant.
8. Generate a New Logical Equivalence Rule (If Applicable): Create an "Equivalent Queries: <query1>
<query2>
Schema Conditions:<conditions>" statement that defines the equivalence. Use GENERALIZED COLUMN and TABLE NAMES. Specify any necessary conditions based on the database schema. Present the rule clearly, indicating both the equivalence and the conditions under which it holds.

INFO:root:model: gpt-4o
INFO:root:prompt: You are an expert SQL engineer with 20+ years of experience. You will be given some SQL equivalence rules conditional on some database schemas. You will then be given a pair of SQL queries, consisting of a gold query and a machine-generated query, and a database schema that defines the context of the queries. 

Your task is to compare the two provided SQL queries on logical equivalence and generate one more equivalence rule in the same format as the provided example equivalence rules.

Please make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please also keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.



Evaluation Criteria:

Logical equivalence - the alignment between the gold SQL query and the machine-generated SQL query. A machine-generated SQL query is logically equivalent to the gold query if these two queries would RETURN THE SAME RESULTS AND IN THE SAME ORDER for ALL POSSIBLE DATABASE INSTANCES that satisfy the provided database schema for these queries. Annotators were asked to penalize machine-generated queries that overlooked edge cases that the gold queries would have caught otherwise.



Evaluation steps:

1. Understand the Database Schema: Identify all tables used in both queries. List all columns referenced, along with their data types and constraints. Determine primary and foreign key relationships. Note any indexes or unique constraints that may affect query execution.
2. Parse and Break Down Each Query: Identify selected columns, functions, and expressions. Note the tables involved and the join conditions. Understand the filtering conditions applied. Identify grouping and aggregate conditions, if any. Determine if result ordering affects equivalence.
3. Compare Query Components: Check if both queries use the same tables and join conditions. Compare filtering conditions in the WHERE clauses. Assess whether the same columns and expressions are selected. Identify if different functions or syntaxes achieve the same result. Look for logical equivalence in expressions and calculations.
4. Consider Edge Cases and Data Variations: Conceptualize sample datasets that include edge cases (e.g., NULL values, zero values, special characters). Analyze how each query handles these edge cases. Ensure that data type differences do not affect the outcome. Verify that constraints (e.g., NOT NULL, UNIQUE) are accounted for.
5. Evaluate Aggregations and Calculations: Confirm that aggregate functions (e.g., SUM, COUNT) are applied identically. Ensure calculations (e.g., subtraction, addition) produce the same results.
6. Check for Logical Equivalence in Conditional Expressions: Compare conditional expressions like IIF, CASE WHEN, and IF. Determine if conditions and returned values are logically the same.
7. Assess Ordering of Results: If ORDER BY clause is present, confirm that both queries order results identically. Recognize that differing order may affect equivalence if result order is significant.
8. Generate a New Logical Equivalence Rule (If Applicable): Create an "Equivalent Queries: <query1>
<query2>
Schema Conditions:<conditions>" statement that defines the equivalence. Use GENERALIZED COLUMN and TABLE NAMES. Specify any necessary conditions based on the database schema. Present the rule clearly, indicating both the equivalence and the conditions under which it holds.

# Guidelines:
- Make SURE complete to every step PERFECTLY without ANY Mistakes
- Follow the Rules I Gave you and Remember to AVOID generating repeated equivalence rules in the examples I gave you.
- Be sure to format your response like the example equivalence rules I gave you.
- Put <New Rule></New Rule> around the new equivalence rule that you think of. Do not use other formatting around the equivalent queries.
- Use GENERALIZED COLUMN AND TABLE NAMES in any EQUIVALENCE RULE YOU WRITE. DO NOT USE THE SAME NAMES IN THE PROVIDED QUERY PAIRS!!!!
- If the two queries are not logically equivalent, say <New Rule> Not equivalent </New Rule>.
- If the new equivalence rule is already repeated in the examples listed, say <New Rule> Rule exists </New Rule>.
- The new rule should be be MINIMAL to CLEARLY demonstrate the highlighted semantic difference. Use ellipses to shorten SQL queries where necessary to achieve this.

Take a Deep Breath and Carefully Follow the Rules, Guides and Examples I gave you. I will tip you $2000 if you do EVERYTHING Perfectly.

INFO:root:model: gpt-4o
INFO:root:prompt: You are an expert SQL engineer with 20+ years of experience. You will be given some SQL equivalence rules conditional on some database schemas. You will then be given a pair of SQL queries, consisting of a gold query and a machine-generated query, and a database schema that defines the context of the queries. 

Your task is to compare the two provided SQL queries on logical equivalence and generate one more equivalence rule in the same format as the provided example equivalence rules.

Please make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please also keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.



Evaluation Criteria:

Logical equivalence - the alignment between the gold SQL query and the machine-generated SQL query. A machine-generated SQL query is logically equivalent to the gold query if these two queries would RETURN THE SAME RESULTS AND IN THE SAME ORDER for ALL POSSIBLE DATABASE INSTANCES that satisfy the provided database schema for these queries. Annotators were asked to penalize machine-generated queries that overlooked edge cases that the gold queries would have caught otherwise.



Evaluation steps:

1. Understand the Database Schema: Identify all tables used in both queries. List all columns referenced, along with their data types and constraints. Determine primary and foreign key relationships. Note any indexes or unique constraints that may affect query execution.
2. Parse and Break Down Each Query: Identify selected columns, functions, and expressions. Note the tables involved and the join conditions. Understand the filtering conditions applied. Identify grouping and aggregate conditions, if any. Determine if result ordering affects equivalence.
3. Compare Query Components: Check if both queries use the same tables and join conditions. Compare filtering conditions in the WHERE clauses. Assess whether the same columns and expressions are selected. Identify if different functions or syntaxes achieve the same result. Look for logical equivalence in expressions and calculations.
4. Consider Edge Cases and Data Variations: Conceptualize sample datasets that include edge cases (e.g., NULL values, zero values, special characters). Analyze how each query handles these edge cases. Ensure that data type differences do not affect the outcome. Verify that constraints (e.g., NOT NULL, UNIQUE) are accounted for.
5. Evaluate Aggregations and Calculations: Confirm that aggregate functions (e.g., SUM, COUNT) are applied identically. Ensure calculations (e.g., subtraction, addition) produce the same results.
6. Check for Logical Equivalence in Conditional Expressions: Compare conditional expressions like IIF, CASE WHEN, and IF. Determine if conditions and returned values are logically the same.
7. Assess Ordering of Results: If ORDER BY clause is present, confirm that both queries order results identically. Recognize that differing order may affect equivalence if result order is significant.
8. Generate a New Logical Equivalence Rule (If Applicable): Create an "Equivalent Queries: <query1>
<query2>
Schema Conditions:<conditions>" statement that defines the equivalence. Use GENERALIZED COLUMN and TABLE NAMES. Specify any necessary conditions based on the database schema. Present the rule clearly, indicating both the equivalence and the conditions under which it holds.



Example Equivalence Rules:

<Rule1>
Equivalent Queries:
SELECT ... FROM table1 INNER JOIN table2 ON table1.col1 = table2.col1 WHERE table1.col2 = 'value' AND strftime('%Y', table2.date_col) = 'YYYY';

Equivalent Queries:
SELECT COUNT(primary_key_col) FROM table WHERE condition1 AND column = (SELECT MAX(column) FROM table);

# Guidelines:
- Make SURE complete to every step PERFECTLY without ANY Mistakes
- Follow the Rules I Gave you and Remember to AVOID generating repeated equivalence rules in the examples I gave you.
- Be sure to format your response like the example equivalence rules I gave you.
- Put <New Rule></New Rule> around the new equivalence rule that you think of. Do not use other formatting around the equivalent queries.
- Use GENERALIZED COLUMN AND TABLE NAMES in any EQUIVALENCE RULE YOU WRITE. DO NOT USE THE SAME NAMES IN THE PROVIDED QUERY PAIRS!!!!
- If the two queries are not logically equivalent, say <New Rule> Not equivalent </New Rule>.
- If the new equivalence rule is already repeated in the examples listed, say <New Rule> Rule exists </New Rule>.
- The new rule should be be MINIMAL to CLEARLY demonstrate the highlighted semantic difference. Use ellipses to shorten SQL queries where necessary to achieve this.

Take a Deep Breath and Carefully Follow the Rules, Guides and Examples I gave you. I will tip you $2000 if you do EVERYTHING Perfectly.

INFO:root:model: gpt-4o
INFO:root:prompt: You are an expert SQL engineer with 20+ years of experience. You will be given some SQL equivalence rules conditional on some database schemas. You will then be given a pair of SQL queries, consisting of a gold query and a machine-generated query, and a database schema that defines the context of the queries. 

Your task is to compare the two provided SQL queries on logical equivalence and generate one more equivalence rule in the same format as the provided example equivalence rules.

Please make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please also keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.



Evaluation Criteria:

Logical equivalence - the alignment between the gold SQL query and the machine-generated SQL query. A machine-generated SQL query is logically equivalent to the gold query if these two queries would RETURN THE SAME RESULTS AND IN THE SAME ORDER for ALL POSSIBLE DATABASE INSTANCES that satisfy the provided database schema for these queries. Annotators were asked to penalize machine-generated queries that overlooked edge cases that the gold queries would have caught otherwise.



Evaluation steps:

1. Understand the Database Schema: Identify all tables used in both queries. List all columns referenced, along with their data types and constraints. Determine primary and foreign key relationships. Note any indexes or unique constraints that may affect query execution.
2. Parse and Break Down Each Query: Identify selected columns, functions, and expressions. Note the tables involved and the join conditions. Understand the filtering conditions applied. Identify grouping and aggregate conditions, if any. Determine if result ordering affects equivalence.
3. Compare Query Components: Check if both queries use the same tables and join conditions. Compare filtering conditions in the WHERE clauses. Assess whether the same columns and expressions are selected. Identify if different functions or syntaxes achieve the same result. Look for logical equivalence in expressions and calculations.
4. Consider Edge Cases and Data Variations: Conceptualize sample datasets that include edge cases (e.g., NULL values, zero values, special characters). Analyze how each query handles these edge cases. Ensure that data type differences do not affect the outcome. Verify that constraints (e.g., NOT NULL, UNIQUE) are accounted for.
5. Evaluate Aggregations and Calculations: Confirm that aggregate functions (e.g., SUM, COUNT) are applied identically. Ensure calculations (e.g., subtraction, addition) produce the same results.
6. Check for Logical Equivalence in Conditional Expressions: Compare conditional expressions like IIF, CASE WHEN, and IF. Determine if conditions and returned values are logically the same.
7. Assess Ordering of Results: If ORDER BY clause is present, confirm that both queries order results identically. Recognize that differing order may affect equivalence if result order is significant.
8. Generate a New Logical Equivalence Rule (If Applicable): Create an "Equivalent Queries: <query1>
<query2>
Schema Conditions:<conditions>" statement that defines the equivalence. Use GENERALIZED COLUMN and TABLE NAMES. Specify any necessary conditions based on the database schema. Present the rule clearly, indicating both the equivalence and the conditions under which it holds.



Example Equivalence Rules:

<Rule1>
Equivalent Queries:
SELECT ... FROM table1 INNER JOIN table2 ON table1.col1 = table2.col1 WHERE table2.col2 = 'value' AND table1.col3 * 100 > (SELECT AVG(col3) FROM table1) * 79;

# Guidelines:
- Make SURE complete to every step PERFECTLY without ANY Mistakes
- Follow the Rules I Gave you and Remember to AVOID generating repeated equivalence rules in the examples I gave you.
- Be sure to format your response like the example equivalence rules I gave you.
- Put <New Rule></New Rule> around the new equivalence rule that you think of. Do not use other formatting around the equivalent queries.
- Use GENERALIZED COLUMN AND TABLE NAMES in any EQUIVALENCE RULE YOU WRITE. DO NOT USE THE SAME NAMES IN THE PROVIDED QUERY PAIRS!!!!
- If the two queries are not logically equivalent, say <New Rule> Not equivalent </New Rule>.
- If the new equivalence rule is already repeated in the examples listed, say <New Rule> Rule exists </New Rule>.
- The new rule should be be MINIMAL to CLEARLY demonstrate the highlighted semantic difference. Use ellipses to shorten SQL queries where necessary to achieve this.

Take a Deep Breath and Carefully Follow the Rules, Guides and Examples I gave you. I will tip you $2000 if you do EVERYTHING Perfectly.

INFO:root:model: gpt-4o
INFO:root:prompt: You are an expert SQL engineer with 20+ years of experience. You will be given some SQL equivalence rules conditional on some database schemas. You will then be given a pair of SQL queries, consisting of a gold query and a machine-generated query, and a database schema that defines the context of the queries. 

Your task is to compare the two provided SQL queries on logical equivalence and generate one more equivalence rule in the same format as the provided example equivalence rules.

Please make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please also keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.



Evaluation Criteria:

Logical equivalence - the alignment between the gold SQL query and the machine-generated SQL query. A machine-generated SQL query is logically equivalent to the gold query if these two queries would RETURN THE SAME RESULTS AND IN THE SAME ORDER for ALL POSSIBLE DATABASE INSTANCES that satisfy the provided database schema for these queries. Annotators were asked to penalize machine-generated queries that overlooked edge cases that the gold queries would have caught otherwise.



Evaluation steps:

1. Understand the Database Schema: Identify all tables used in both queries. List all columns referenced, along with their data types and constraints. Determine primary and foreign key relationships. Note any indexes or unique constraints that may affect query execution.
2. Parse and Break Down Each Query: Identify selected columns, functions, and expressions. Note the tables involved and the join conditions. Understand the filtering conditions applied. Identify grouping and aggregate conditions, if any. Determine if result ordering affects equivalence.
3. Compare Query Components: Check if both queries use the same tables and join conditions. Compare filtering conditions in the WHERE clauses. Assess whether the same columns and expressions are selected. Identify if different functions or syntaxes achieve the same result. Look for logical equivalence in expressions and calculations.
4. Consider Edge Cases and Data Variations: Conceptualize sample datasets that include edge cases (e.g., NULL values, zero values, special characters). Analyze how each query handles these edge cases. Ensure that data type differences do not affect the outcome. Verify that constraints (e.g., NOT NULL, UNIQUE) are accounted for.
5. Evaluate Aggregations and Calculations: Confirm that aggregate functions (e.g., SUM, COUNT) are applied identically. Ensure calculations (e.g., subtraction, addition) produce the same results.
6. Check for Logical Equivalence in Conditional Expressions: Compare conditional expressions like IIF, CASE WHEN, and IF. Determine if conditions and returned values are logically the same.
7. Assess Ordering of Results: If ORDER BY clause is present, confirm that both queries order results identically. Recognize that differing order may affect equivalence if result order is significant.
8. Generate a New Logical Equivalence Rule (If Applicable): Create an "Equivalent Queries: <query1>
<query2>
Schema Conditions:<conditions>" statement that defines the equivalence. Use GENERALIZED COLUMN and TABLE NAMES. Specify any necessary conditions based on the database schema. Present the rule clearly, indicating both the equivalence and the conditions under which it holds.

# Guidelines:
- Make SURE complete to every step PERFECTLY without ANY Mistakes
- Follow the Rules I Gave you and Remember to AVOID generating repeated equivalence rules in the examples I gave you.
- Be sure to format your response like the example equivalence rules I gave you.
- Put <New Rule></New Rule> around the new equivalence rule that you think of. Do not use other formatting around the equivalent queries.
- Use GENERALIZED COLUMN AND TABLE NAMES in any EQUIVALENCE RULE YOU WRITE. DO NOT USE THE SAME NAMES IN THE PROVIDED QUERY PAIRS!!!!
- If the two queries are not logically equivalent, say <New Rule> Not equivalent </New Rule>.
- If the new equivalence rule is already repeated in the examples listed, say <New Rule> Rule exists </New Rule>.
- The new rule should be be MINIMAL to CLEARLY demonstrate the highlighted semantic difference. Use ellipses to shorten SQL queries where necessary to achieve this.

Take a Deep Breath and Carefully Follow the Rules, Guides and Examples I gave you. I will tip you $2000 if you do EVERYTHING Perfectly.



Pair of SQL Queries:
<Gold SQL Query>
SELECT T2.Body FROM tags AS T1 INNER JOIN posts AS T2 ON T2.Id = T1.ExcerptPostId WHERE T1.TagName = 'bayesian';
</Gold SQL Query>

<Machine-generated SQL Query>
SELECT posts.body FROM tags INNER JOIN posts ON tags.excerptpostid = posts.id WHERE tags.tagname = 'bayesian';

The differences are only in the use of aliases, which do not affect the logical outcome.\n\n### Step 8: Generate a New Logical Equivalence Rule\nSince this specific rule about alias usage and logical equivalence has not been provided in the example rules, we can generate a new rule:\n\n<New Rule>\nEquivalent Queries:\nSELECT T1.col1 FROM table1 AS T1 INNER JOIN table2 AS T2 ON T2.col2 = T1.col2 WHERE T1.col3 = 'value';\nSELECT table1.col1 FROM table1 INNER JOIN table2 ON table2.col2 = table1.col2 WHERE table1.col3 = 'value';\nSchema Conditions:\ntable1.col2 is a foreign key referencing table2.col2, and table2.col2 is a primary key.\n", role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None, refusal=None))], created=1730778770, model='gpt-4o-2024-08-06', object='chat.completion', system_fingerprint='fp_45cf54deae', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=758, prompt_tokens=3473, total_tokens=4231, prompt_tokens_details={'cached_tokens': 0}, completion_tokens_details={'reasoning_tokens': 0, 'accepted_prediction_tokens': 0, 'rejected_prediction_tokens': 0}))

INFO:root:model: gpt-4o
INFO:root:prompt: You are an expert SQL engineer with 20+ years of experience. You will be given some SQL equivalence rules conditional on some database schemas. You will then be given a pair of SQL queries, consisting of a gold query and a machine-generated query, and a database schema that defines the context of the queries. 

Your task is to compare the two provided SQL queries on logical equivalence and generate one more equivalence rule in the same format as the provided example equivalence rules.

Please make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please also keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.



Evaluation Criteria:

Logical equivalence - the alignment between the gold SQL query and the machine-generated SQL query. A machine-generated SQL query is logically equivalent to the gold query if these two queries would RETURN THE SAME RESULTS AND IN THE SAME ORDER for ALL POSSIBLE DATABASE INSTANCES that satisfy the provided database schema for these queries. Annotators were asked to penalize machine-generated queries that overlooked edge cases that the gold queries would have caught otherwise.



Evaluation steps:

1. Understand the Database Schema: Identify all tables used in both queries. List all columns referenced, along with their data types and constraints. Determine primary and foreign key relationships. Note any indexes or unique constraints that may affect query execution.
2. Parse and Break Down Each Query: Identify selected columns, functions, and expressions. Note the tables involved and the join conditions. Understand the filtering conditions applied. Identify grouping and aggregate conditions, if any. Determine if result ordering affects equivalence.
3. Compare Query Components: Check if both queries use the same tables and join conditions. Compare filtering conditions in the WHERE clauses. Assess whether the same columns and expressions are selected. Identify if different functions or syntaxes achieve the same result. Look for logical equivalence in expressions and calculations.
4. Consider Edge Cases and Data Variations: Conceptualize sample datasets that include edge cases (e.g., NULL values, zero values, special characters). Analyze how each query handles these edge cases. Ensure that data type differences do not affect the outcome. Verify that constraints (e.g., NOT NULL, UNIQUE) are accounted for.
5. Evaluate Aggregations and Calculations: Confirm that aggregate functions (e.g., SUM, COUNT) are applied identically. Ensure calculations (e.g., subtraction, addition) produce the same results.
6. Check for Logical Equivalence in Conditional Expressions: Compare conditional expressions like IIF, CASE WHEN, and IF. Determine if conditions and returned values are logically the same.
7. Assess Ordering of Results: If ORDER BY clause is present, confirm that both queries order results identically. Recognize that differing order may affect equivalence if result order is significant.
8. Generate a New Logical Equivalence Rule (If Applicable): Create an "Equivalent Queries: <query1>
<query2>
Schema Conditions:<conditions>" statement that defines the equivalence. Use GENERALIZED COLUMN and TABLE NAMES. Specify any necessary conditions based on the database schema. Present the rule clearly, indicating both the equivalence and the conditions under which it holds.



Example Equivalence Rules:

<Rule1>
Equivalent Queries:
SELECT COUNT(primary_key_col) FROM table WHERE condition1 AND column = (SELECT MAX(column) FROM table);
SELECT COUNT(foreign_key_col) FROM table WHERE condition1 AND column = (SELECT MAX(column) FROM table);
Schema Conditions:
foreign_key_col is a non-nullable foreign key.
</Rule1>

<Rule2>
Equivalent Queries:
SELECT ... FROM table1 INNER JOIN table2 ON table1.col1 = table2.col1 WHERE table2.col2 = 'value' AND table1.col3 * 100 > (SELECT AVG(col3) FROM table1) * 79;
SELECT ... FROM table1 INNER JOIN table2 ON table1.col1 = table2.col1 WHERE table2.col2 = 'value' AND table1.col3 > (SELECT AVG(col3) * 0.79 FROM table1);
Schema Conditions:
None.
</Rule2>

<Rule3>
Equivalent Queries:
SELECT T2.col2 FROM table1 AS T1 INNER JOIN table2 AS T2 ON T1.col1 = T2.col1 WHERE T1.col3 = 'value1' AND T1.col4 = 'value2';
SELECT table2.col2 FROM table2 INNER JOIN table1 ON table2.col1 = table1.col1 WHERE table1.col3 = 'value1' AND table1.col4 = 'value2';
Schema Conditions:
table1.col1 is a foreign key referencing table2.col1, and table2.col1 is a primary key.
</Rule3>

<Rule4>
Equivalent Queries:
SELECT CAST(COUNT(CASE WHEN t1.col1 = 'value' THEN t2.col2 END) AS REAL) * 100 / COUNT(t2.col2) FROM table1 AS t1 INNER JOIN table2 AS t2 ON t2.col2 = t1.col2 WHERE t2.col3 = 'value';
SELECT CAST(SUM(CASE WHEN table1.col1 = 'value' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS REAL) * 100 / COUNT(table2.col2) FROM table2 INNER JOIN table1 ON table2.col2 = table1.col2 WHERE table2.col3 = 'value';
Schema Conditions:
table2.col2 is a foreign key referencing table1.col2, and table1.col2 is a primary key.
</Rule4>

<Rule5>
Equivalent Queries:
SELECT column_name FROM table_name WHERE SUBSTR(date_column, 1, 7) = 'YYYY-MM';
SELECT column_name FROM table_name WHERE date_column LIKE 'YYYY-MM%';
Schema Conditions:
None.
</Rule5>

# Guidelines:
- Make SURE complete to every step PERFECTLY without ANY Mistakes
- Follow the Rules I Gave you and Remember to AVOID generating repeated equivalence rules in the examples I gave you.
- Be sure to format your response like the example equivalence rules I gave you.
- Put <New Rule></New Rule> around the new equivalence rule that you think of. Do not use other formatting around the equivalent queries.
- Use GENERALIZED COLUMN AND TABLE NAMES in any EQUIVALENCE RULE YOU WRITE. DO NOT USE THE SAME NAMES IN THE PROVIDED QUERY PAIRS!!!!
- If the two queries are not logically equivalent, say <New Rule> Not equivalent </New Rule>.
- If the new equivalence rule is already repeated in the examples listed, say <New Rule> Rule exists </New Rule>.
- The new rule should be be MINIMAL to CLEARLY demonstrate the highlighted semantic difference. Use ellipses to shorten SQL queries where necessary to achieve this.

Take a Deep Breath and Carefully Follow the Rules, Guides and Examples I gave you. I will tip you $2000 if you do EVERYTHING Perfectly.

INFO:root:model: gpt-4o
INFO:root:prompt: You are an expert SQL engineer with 20+ years of experience. You will be given some SQL equivalence rules conditional on some database schemas. You will then be given a pair of SQL queries, consisting of a gold query and a machine-generated query, and a database schema that defines the context of the queries. 

Your task is to compare the two provided SQL queries on logical equivalence and generate one more equivalence rule in the same format as the provided example equivalence rules.

Please make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please also keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.



Evaluation Criteria:

Logical equivalence - the alignment between the gold SQL query and the machine-generated SQL query. A machine-generated SQL query is logically equivalent to the gold query if these two queries would RETURN THE SAME RESULTS AND IN THE SAME ORDER for ALL POSSIBLE DATABASE INSTANCES that satisfy the provided database schema for these queries. Annotators were asked to penalize machine-generated queries that overlooked edge cases that the gold queries would have caught otherwise.



Evaluation steps:

1. Understand the Database Schema: Identify all tables used in both queries. List all columns referenced, along with their data types and constraints. Determine primary and foreign key relationships. Note any indexes or unique constraints that may affect query execution.
2. Parse and Break Down Each Query: Identify selected columns, functions, and expressions. Note the tables involved and the join conditions. Understand the filtering conditions applied. Identify grouping and aggregate conditions, if any. Determine if result ordering affects equivalence.
3. Compare Query Components: Check if both queries use the same tables and join conditions. Compare filtering conditions in the WHERE clauses. Assess whether the same columns and expressions are selected. Identify if different functions or syntaxes achieve the same result. Look for logical equivalence in expressions and calculations.
4. Consider Edge Cases and Data Variations: Conceptualize sample datasets that include edge cases (e.g., NULL values, zero values, special characters). Analyze how each query handles these edge cases. Ensure that data type differences do not affect the outcome. Verify that constraints (e.g., NOT NULL, UNIQUE) are accounted for.
5. Evaluate Aggregations and Calculations: Confirm that aggregate functions (e.g., SUM, COUNT) are applied identically. Ensure calculations (e.g., subtraction, addition) produce the same results.
6. Check for Logical Equivalence in Conditional Expressions: Compare conditional expressions like IIF, CASE WHEN, and IF. Determine if conditions and returned values are logically the same.
7. Assess Ordering of Results: If ORDER BY clause is present, confirm that both queries order results identically. Recognize that differing order may affect equivalence if result order is significant.
8. Generate a New Logical Equivalence Rule (If Applicable): Create an "Equivalent Queries: <query1>
<query2>
Schema Conditions:<conditions>" statement that defines the equivalence. Use GENERALIZED COLUMN and TABLE NAMES. Specify any necessary conditions based on the database schema. Present the rule clearly, indicating both the equivalence and the conditions under which it holds.



Example Equivalence Rules:

<Rule1>
Equivalent Queries:
SELECT CAST(SUM(IIF(condition, 1, 0)) AS FLOAT) / SUM(IIF(condition, 1, 0)) FROM table;
SELECT CAST(SUM(CASE WHEN condition THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS REAL) / SUM(CASE WHEN condition THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) FROM table;
Schema Conditions:
None.
</Rule1>

<Rule2>
Equivalent Queries:
SELECT column_name FROM table_name WHERE SUBSTR(date_column, 1, 7) = 'YYYY-MM';
SELECT column_name FROM table_name WHERE date_column LIKE 'YYYY-MM%';
Schema Conditions:
None.
</Rule2>

<Rule3>
Equivalent Queries:
SELECT ... FROM table1 INNER JOIN table2 ON table1.col1 = table2.col1 WHERE table2.col2 = 'value' AND table1.col3 * 100 > (SELECT AVG(col3) FROM table1) * 79;
SELECT ... FROM table1 INNER JOIN table2 ON table1.col1 = table2.col1 WHERE table2.col2 = 'value' AND table1.col3 > (SELECT AVG(col3) * 0.79 FROM table1);
Schema Conditions:
None.
</Rule3>

# Guidelines:
- Make SURE complete to every step PERFECTLY without ANY Mistakes
- Follow the Rules I Gave you and Remember to AVOID generating repeated equivalence rules in the examples I gave you.
- Be sure to format your response like the example equivalence rules I gave you.
- Put <New Rule></New Rule> around the new equivalence rule that you think of. Do not use other formatting around the equivalent queries.
- Use GENERALIZED COLUMN AND TABLE NAMES in any EQUIVALENCE RULE YOU WRITE. DO NOT USE THE SAME NAMES IN THE PROVIDED QUERY PAIRS!!!!
- If the two queries are not logically equivalent, say <New Rule> Not equivalent </New Rule>.
- If the new equivalence rule is already repeated in the examples listed, say <New Rule> Rule exists </New Rule>.
- The new rule should be be MINIMAL to CLEARLY demonstrate the highlighted semantic difference. Use ellipses to shorten SQL queries where necessary to achieve this.

Take a Deep Breath and Carefully Follow the Rules, Guides and Examples I gave you. I will tip you $2000 if you do EVERYTHING Perfectly.

INFO:root:model: gpt-4o
INFO:root:prompt: You are an expert SQL engineer with 20+ years of experience. You will be given some SQL equivalence rules conditional on some database schemas. You will then be given a pair of SQL queries, consisting of a gold query and a machine-generated query, and a database schema that defines the context of the queries. 

Your task is to compare the two provided SQL queries on logical equivalence and generate one more equivalence rule in the same format as the provided example equivalence rules.

Please make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please also keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.



Evaluation Criteria:

Logical equivalence - the alignment between the gold SQL query and the machine-generated SQL query. A machine-generated SQL query is logically equivalent to the gold query if these two queries would RETURN THE SAME RESULTS AND IN THE SAME ORDER for ALL POSSIBLE DATABASE INSTANCES that satisfy the provided database schema for these queries. Annotators were asked to penalize machine-generated queries that overlooked edge cases that the gold queries would have caught otherwise.



Evaluation steps:

1. Understand the Database Schema: Identify all tables used in both queries. List all columns referenced, along with their data types and constraints. Determine primary and foreign key relationships. Note any indexes or unique constraints that may affect query execution.
2. Parse and Break Down Each Query: Identify selected columns, functions, and expressions. Note the tables involved and the join conditions. Understand the filtering conditions applied. Identify grouping and aggregate conditions, if any. Determine if result ordering affects equivalence.
3. Compare Query Components: Check if both queries use the same tables and join conditions. Compare filtering conditions in the WHERE clauses. Assess whether the same columns and expressions are selected. Identify if different functions or syntaxes achieve the same result. Look for logical equivalence in expressions and calculations.
4. Consider Edge Cases and Data Variations: Conceptualize sample datasets that include edge cases (e.g., NULL values, zero values, special characters). Analyze how each query handles these edge cases. Ensure that data type differences do not affect the outcome. Verify that constraints (e.g., NOT NULL, UNIQUE) are accounted for.
5. Evaluate Aggregations and Calculations: Confirm that aggregate functions (e.g., SUM, COUNT) are applied identically. Ensure calculations (e.g., subtraction, addition) produce the same results.
6. Check for Logical Equivalence in Conditional Expressions: Compare conditional expressions like IIF, CASE WHEN, and IF. Determine if conditions and returned values are logically the same.
7. Assess Ordering of Results: If ORDER BY clause is present, confirm that both queries order results identically. Recognize that differing order may affect equivalence if result order is significant.
8. Generate a New Logical Equivalence Rule (If Applicable): Create an "Equivalent Queries: <query1>
<query2>
Schema Conditions:<conditions>" statement that defines the equivalence. Use GENERALIZED COLUMN and TABLE NAMES. Specify any necessary conditions based on the database schema. Present the rule clearly, indicating both the equivalence and the conditions under which it holds.



Example Equivalence Rules:

<Rule1>
Equivalent Queries:
SELECT CAST(COUNT(CASE WHEN t1.col1 = 'value' THEN t2.col2 END) AS REAL) * 100 / COUNT(t2.col2) FROM table1 AS t1 INNER JOIN table2 AS t2 ON t2.col2 = t1.col2 WHERE t2.col3 = 'value';
SELECT CAST(SUM(CASE WHEN table1.col1 = 'value' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS REAL) * 100 / COUNT(table2.col2) FROM table2 INNER JOIN table1 ON table2.col2 = table1.col2 WHERE table2.col3 = 'value';

# Guidelines:
- Make SURE complete to every step PERFECTLY without ANY Mistakes
- Follow the Rules I Gave you and Remember to AVOID generating repeated equivalence rules in the examples I gave you.
- Be sure to format your response like the example equivalence rules I gave you.
- Put <New Rule></New Rule> around the new equivalence rule that you think of. Do not use other formatting around the equivalent queries.
- Use GENERALIZED COLUMN AND TABLE NAMES in any EQUIVALENCE RULE YOU WRITE. DO NOT USE THE SAME NAMES IN THE PROVIDED QUERY PAIRS!!!!
- If the two queries are not logically equivalent, say <New Rule> Not equivalent </New Rule>.
- If the new equivalence rule is already repeated in the examples listed, say <New Rule> Rule exists </New Rule>.
- The new rule should be be MINIMAL to CLEARLY demonstrate the highlighted semantic difference. Use ellipses to shorten SQL queries where necessary to achieve this.

Take a Deep Breath and Carefully Follow the Rules, Guides and Examples I gave you. I will tip you $2000 if you do EVERYTHING Perfectly.

INFO:root:prompt: You are an expert SQL engineer with 20+ years of experience. You will be given some SQL equivalence rules conditional on some database schemas. You will then be given a pair of SQL queries, consisting of a gold query and a machine-generated query, and a database schema that defines the context of the queries. 

Your task is to compare the two provided SQL queries on logical equivalence and generate one more equivalence rule in the same format as the provided example equivalence rules.

Please make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please also keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.



Evaluation Criteria:

Logical equivalence - the alignment between the gold SQL query and the machine-generated SQL query. A machine-generated SQL query is logically equivalent to the gold query if these two queries would RETURN THE SAME RESULTS AND IN THE SAME ORDER for ALL POSSIBLE DATABASE INSTANCES that satisfy the provided database schema for these queries. Annotators were asked to penalize machine-generated queries that overlooked edge cases that the gold queries would have caught otherwise.



Evaluation steps:

1. Understand the Database Schema: Identify all tables used in both queries. List all columns referenced, along with their data types and constraints. Determine primary and foreign key relationships. Note any indexes or unique constraints that may affect query execution.
2. Parse and Break Down Each Query: Identify selected columns, functions, and expressions. Note the tables involved and the join conditions. Understand the filtering conditions applied. Identify grouping and aggregate conditions, if any. Determine if result ordering affects equivalence.
3. Compare Query Components: Check if both queries use the same tables and join conditions. Compare filtering conditions in the WHERE clauses. Assess whether the same columns and expressions are selected. Identify if different functions or syntaxes achieve the same result. Look for logical equivalence in expressions and calculations.
4. Consider Edge Cases and Data Variations: Conceptualize sample datasets that include edge cases (e.g., NULL values, zero values, special characters). Analyze how each query handles these edge cases. Ensure that data type differences do not affect the outcome. Verify that constraints (e.g., NOT NULL, UNIQUE) are accounted for.
5. Evaluate Aggregations and Calculations: Confirm that aggregate functions (e.g., SUM, COUNT) are applied identically. Ensure calculations (e.g., subtraction, addition) produce the same results.
6. Check for Logical Equivalence in Conditional Expressions: Compare conditional expressions like IIF, CASE WHEN, and IF. Determine if conditions and returned values are logically the same.
7. Assess Ordering of Results: If ORDER BY clause is present, confirm that both queries order results identically. Recognize that differing order may affect equivalence if result order is significant.
8. Generate a New Logical Equivalence Rule (If Applicable): Create an "Equivalent Queries: <query1>
<query2>
Schema Conditions:<conditions>" statement that defines the equivalence. Use GENERALIZED COLUMN and TABLE NAMES. Specify any necessary conditions based on the database schema. Present the rule clearly, indicating both the equivalence and the conditions under which it holds.

# Guidelines:
- Make SURE complete to every step PERFECTLY without ANY Mistakes
- Follow the Rules I Gave you and Remember to AVOID generating repeated equivalence rules in the examples I gave you.
- Be sure to format your response like the example equivalence rules I gave you.
- Put <New Rule></New Rule> around the new equivalence rule that you think of. Do not use other formatting around the equivalent queries.
- Use GENERALIZED COLUMN AND TABLE NAMES in any EQUIVALENCE RULE YOU WRITE. DO NOT USE THE SAME NAMES IN THE PROVIDED QUERY PAIRS!!!!
- If the two queries are not logically equivalent, say <New Rule> Not equivalent </New Rule>.
- If the new equivalence rule is already repeated in the examples listed, say <New Rule> Rule exists </New Rule>.
- The new rule should be be MINIMAL to CLEARLY demonstrate the highlighted semantic difference. Use ellipses to shorten SQL queries where necessary to achieve this.

Take a Deep Breath and Carefully Follow the Rules, Guides and Examples I gave you. I will tip you $2000 if you do EVERYTHING Perfectly.

INFO:root:model: gpt-4o
INFO:root:prompt: You are an expert SQL engineer with 20+ years of experience. You will be given some SQL equivalence rules conditional on some database schemas. You will then be given a pair of SQL queries, consisting of a gold query and a machine-generated query, and a database schema that defines the context of the queries. 

Your task is to compare the two provided SQL queries on logical equivalence and generate one more equivalence rule in the same format as the provided example equivalence rules.

Please make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please also keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.



Evaluation Criteria:

Logical equivalence - the alignment between the gold SQL query and the machine-generated SQL query. A machine-generated SQL query is logically equivalent to the gold query if these two queries would RETURN THE SAME RESULTS AND IN THE SAME ORDER for ALL POSSIBLE DATABASE INSTANCES that satisfy the provided database schema for these queries. Annotators were asked to penalize machine-generated queries that overlooked edge cases that the gold queries would have caught otherwise.



Evaluation steps:

1. Understand the Database Schema: Identify all tables used in both queries. List all columns referenced, along with their data types and constraints. Determine primary and foreign key relationships. Note any indexes or unique constraints that may affect query execution.
2. Parse and Break Down Each Query: Identify selected columns, functions, and expressions. Note the tables involved and the join conditions. Understand the filtering conditions applied. Identify grouping and aggregate conditions, if any. Determine if result ordering affects equivalence.
3. Compare Query Components: Check if both queries use the same tables and join conditions. Compare filtering conditions in the WHERE clauses. Assess whether the same columns and expressions are selected. Identify if different functions or syntaxes achieve the same result. Look for logical equivalence in expressions and calculations.
4. Consider Edge Cases and Data Variations: Conceptualize sample datasets that include edge cases (e.g., NULL values, zero values, special characters). Analyze how each query handles these edge cases. Ensure that data type differences do not affect the outcome. Verify that constraints (e.g., NOT NULL, UNIQUE) are accounted for.
5. Evaluate Aggregations and Calculations: Confirm that aggregate functions (e.g., SUM, COUNT) are applied identically. Ensure calculations (e.g., subtraction, addition) produce the same results.
6. Check for Logical Equivalence in Conditional Expressions: Compare conditional expressions like IIF, CASE WHEN, and IF. Determine if conditions and returned values are logically the same.
7. Assess Ordering of Results: If ORDER BY clause is present, confirm that both queries order results identically. Recognize that differing order may affect equivalence if result order is significant.
8. Generate a New Logical Equivalence Rule (If Applicable): Create an "Equivalent Queries: <query1>
<query2>
Schema Conditions:<conditions>" statement that defines the equivalence. Use GENERALIZED COLUMN and TABLE NAMES. Specify any necessary conditions based on the database schema. Present the rule clearly, indicating both the equivalence and the conditions under which it holds.

# Guidelines:
- Make SURE complete to every step PERFECTLY without ANY Mistakes
- Follow the Rules I Gave you and Remember to AVOID generating repeated equivalence rules in the examples I gave you.
- Be sure to format your response like the example equivalence rules I gave you.
- Put <New Rule></New Rule> around the new equivalence rule that you think of. Do not use other formatting around the equivalent queries.
- Use GENERALIZED COLUMN AND TABLE NAMES in any EQUIVALENCE RULE YOU WRITE. DO NOT USE THE SAME NAMES IN THE PROVIDED QUERY PAIRS!!!!
- If the two queries are not logically equivalent, say <New Rule> Not equivalent </New Rule>.
- If the new equivalence rule is already repeated in the examples listed, say <New Rule> Rule exists </New Rule>.
- The new rule should be be MINIMAL to CLEARLY demonstrate the highlighted semantic difference. Use ellipses to shorten SQL queries where necessary to achieve this.

Take a Deep Breath and Carefully Follow the Rules, Guides and Examples I gave you. I will tip you $2000 if you do EVERYTHING Perfectly.

INFO:root:model: gpt-4o
INFO:root:prompt: You are an expert SQL engineer with 20+ years of experience. You will be given some SQL equivalence rules conditional on some database schemas. You will then be given a pair of SQL queries, consisting of a gold query and a machine-generated query, and a database schema that defines the context of the queries. 

Your task is to compare the two provided SQL queries on logical equivalence and generate one more equivalence rule in the same format as the provided example equivalence rules.

Please make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please also keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.



Evaluation Criteria:

Logical equivalence - the alignment between the gold SQL query and the machine-generated SQL query. A machine-generated SQL query is logically equivalent to the gold query if these two queries would RETURN THE SAME RESULTS AND IN THE SAME ORDER for ALL POSSIBLE DATABASE INSTANCES that satisfy the provided database schema for these queries. Annotators were asked to penalize machine-generated queries that overlooked edge cases that the gold queries would have caught otherwise.



Evaluation steps:

1. Understand the Database Schema: Identify all tables used in both queries. List all columns referenced, along with their data types and constraints. Determine primary and foreign key relationships. Note any indexes or unique constraints that may affect query execution.
2. Parse and Break Down Each Query: Identify selected columns, functions, and expressions. Note the tables involved and the join conditions. Understand the filtering conditions applied. Identify grouping and aggregate conditions, if any. Determine if result ordering affects equivalence.
3. Compare Query Components: Check if both queries use the same tables and join conditions. Compare filtering conditions in the WHERE clauses. Assess whether the same columns and expressions are selected. Identify if different functions or syntaxes achieve the same result. Look for logical equivalence in expressions and calculations.
4. Consider Edge Cases and Data Variations: Conceptualize sample datasets that include edge cases (e.g., NULL values, zero values, special characters). Analyze how each query handles these edge cases. Ensure that data type differences do not affect the outcome. Verify that constraints (e.g., NOT NULL, UNIQUE) are accounted for.
5. Evaluate Aggregations and Calculations: Confirm that aggregate functions (e.g., SUM, COUNT) are applied identically. Ensure calculations (e.g., subtraction, addition) produce the same results.
6. Check for Logical Equivalence in Conditional Expressions: Compare conditional expressions like IIF, CASE WHEN, and IF. Determine if conditions and returned values are logically the same.
7. Assess Ordering of Results: If ORDER BY clause is present, confirm that both queries order results identically. Recognize that differing order may affect equivalence if result order is significant.
8. Generate a New Logical Equivalence Rule (If Applicable): Create an "Equivalent Queries: <query1>
<query2>
Schema Conditions:<conditions>" statement that defines the equivalence. Use GENERALIZED COLUMN and TABLE NAMES. Specify any necessary conditions based on the database schema. Present the rule clearly, indicating both the equivalence and the conditions under which it holds.

# Guidelines:
- Make SURE complete to every step PERFECTLY without ANY Mistakes
- Follow the Rules I Gave you and Remember to AVOID generating repeated equivalence rules in the examples I gave you.
- Be sure to format your response like the example equivalence rules I gave you.
- Put <New Rule></New Rule> around the new equivalence rule that you think of. Do not use other formatting around the equivalent queries.
- Use GENERALIZED COLUMN AND TABLE NAMES in any EQUIVALENCE RULE YOU WRITE. DO NOT USE THE SAME NAMES IN THE PROVIDED QUERY PAIRS!!!!
- If the two queries are not logically equivalent, say <New Rule> Not equivalent </New Rule>.
- If the new equivalence rule is already repeated in the examples listed, say <New Rule> Rule exists </New Rule>.
- The new rule should be be MINIMAL to CLEARLY demonstrate the highlighted semantic difference. Use ellipses to shorten SQL queries where necessary to achieve this.

Take a Deep Breath and Carefully Follow the Rules, Guides and Examples I gave you. I will tip you $2000 if you do EVERYTHING Perfectly.

INFO:root:model: gpt-4o
INFO:root:prompt: You are an expert SQL engineer with 20+ years of experience. You will be given some SQL equivalence rules conditional on some database schemas. You will then be given a pair of SQL queries, consisting of a gold query and a machine-generated query, and a database schema that defines the context of the queries. 

Your task is to compare the two provided SQL queries on logical equivalence and generate one more equivalence rule in the same format as the provided example equivalence rules.

Please make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please also keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.



Evaluation Criteria:

Logical equivalence - the alignment between the gold SQL query and the machine-generated SQL query. A machine-generated SQL query is logically equivalent to the gold query if these two queries would RETURN THE SAME RESULTS AND IN THE SAME ORDER for ALL POSSIBLE DATABASE INSTANCES that satisfy the provided database schema for these queries. Annotators were asked to penalize machine-generated queries that overlooked edge cases that the gold queries would have caught otherwise.



Evaluation steps:

1. Understand the Database Schema: Identify all tables used in both queries. List all columns referenced, along with their data types and constraints. Determine primary and foreign key relationships. Note any indexes or unique constraints that may affect query execution.
2. Parse and Break Down Each Query: Identify selected columns, functions, and expressions. Note the tables involved and the join conditions. Understand the filtering conditions applied. Identify grouping and aggregate conditions, if any. Determine if result ordering affects equivalence.
3. Compare Query Components: Check if both queries use the same tables and join conditions. Compare filtering conditions in the WHERE clauses. Assess whether the same columns and expressions are selected. Identify if different functions or syntaxes achieve the same result. Look for logical equivalence in expressions and calculations.
4. Consider Edge Cases and Data Variations: Conceptualize sample datasets that include edge cases (e.g., NULL values, zero values, special characters). Analyze how each query handles these edge cases. Ensure that data type differences do not affect the outcome. Verify that constraints (e.g., NOT NULL, UNIQUE) are accounted for.
5. Evaluate Aggregations and Calculations: Confirm that aggregate functions (e.g., SUM, COUNT) are applied identically. Ensure calculations (e.g., subtraction, addition) produce the same results.
6. Check for Logical Equivalence in Conditional Expressions: Compare conditional expressions like IIF, CASE WHEN, and IF. Determine if conditions and returned values are logically the same.
7. Assess Ordering of Results: If ORDER BY clause is present, confirm that both queries order results identically. Recognize that differing order may affect equivalence if result order is significant.
8. Generate a New Logical Equivalence Rule (If Applicable): Create an "Equivalent Queries: <query1>
<query2>
Schema Conditions:<conditions>" statement that defines the equivalence. Use GENERALIZED COLUMN and TABLE NAMES. Specify any necessary conditions based on the database schema. Present the rule clearly, indicating both the equivalence and the conditions under which it holds.



Example Equivalence Rules:

<Rule1>
Equivalent Queries:
SELECT SUM(IIF(condition1, expr1, 0)) - SUM(IIF(condition2, expr2, 0)) FROM table;
SELECT SUM(CASE WHEN condition1 THEN expr1 ELSE 0 END) - SUM(CASE WHEN condition2 THEN expr2 ELSE 0 END) FROM table;
Schema Conditions:
None.
</Rule1>

<Rule2>
Equivalent Queries:
SELECT CAST(SUM(IIF(condition, 1, 0)) AS FLOAT) * 100 / COUNT(column) FROM table1 INNER JOIN table2 ON table1.col1 = table2.col1 WHERE table1.date_col = 'date_value';
SELECT CAST(SUM(CASE WHEN condition THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS REAL) * 100 / COUNT(column) FROM table2 INNER JOIN table1 ON table2.col1 = table1.col1 WHERE table1.date_col = 'date_value';
Schema Conditions:
table1.col1 is a foreign key referencing table2.col1, and table2.col1 is a primary key.
</Rule2>

<Rule3>
Equivalent Queries:
SELECT column_name FROM table_name WHERE SUBSTR(date_column, 1, 7) = 'YYYY-MM';
SELECT column_name FROM table_name WHERE date_column LIKE 'YYYY-MM%';
Schema Conditions:
None.
</Rule3>

<Rule4>
Equivalent Queries:
SELECT COUNT(primary_key_col) FROM table WHERE condition1 AND column = (SELECT MAX(column) FROM table);
SELECT COUNT(foreign_key_col) FROM table WHERE condition1 AND column = (SELECT MAX(column) FROM table);
Schema Conditions:
foreign_key_col is a non-nullable foreign key.
</Rule4>

<Rule5>
Equivalent Queries:
SELECT ... FROM table1 INNER JOIN table2 ON table1.col1 = table2.col1 WHERE table2.col2 = 'value' AND table1.col3 * 100 > (SELECT AVG(col3) FROM table1) * 79;
SELECT ... FROM table1 INNER JOIN table2 ON table1.col1 = table2.col1 WHERE table2.col2 = 'value' AND table1.col3 > (SELECT AVG(col3) * 0.79 FROM table1);
Schema Conditions:
None.
</Rule5>

<Rule6>
Equivalent Queries:
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM table1 INNER JOIN table2 ON table1.col1 = table2.col2 WHERE condition;
SELECT COUNT(table1.col1) FROM table2 INNER JOIN table1 ON table2.col2 = table1.col1 WHERE condition;
Schema Conditions:
table1.col1 is a non-nullable column that uniquely identifies rows in table1.
</Rule6>

<Rule7>
Equivalent Queries:
SELECT ... FROM table1 INNER JOIN table2 ON table1.col1 = table2.col1 WHERE table1.col2 = 'value' AND strftime('%Y', table2.date_col) = 'YYYY';
SELECT ... FROM table1 INNER JOIN table2 ON table1.col1 = table2.col1 WHERE table1.col2 = 'value' AND table2.date_col LIKE 'YYYY%';
Schema Conditions:
table2.date_col is consistently formatted as 'YYYY-MM-DD'.
</Rule7>

<Rule8>
Equivalent Queries:
SELECT CAST(SUM(column1) AS REAL) / COUNT(column2) FROM table1 INNER JOIN table2 ON table1.col1 = table2.col1 WHERE condition;
SELECT AVG(column1) FROM table1 INNER JOIN table2 ON table1.col1 = table2.col1 WHERE condition;
Schema Conditions:
None.
</Rule8>

Equivalent Queries:
SELECT CAST(SUM(IIF(condition, 1, 0)) AS FLOAT) / SUM(IIF(condition, 1, 0)) FROM table;
SELECT CAST(SUM(CASE WHEN condition THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS REAL) / SUM(CASE WHEN condition THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) FROM table;

# Guidelines:
- Make SURE complete to every step PERFECTLY without ANY Mistakes
- Follow the Rules I Gave you and Remember to AVOID generating repeated equivalence rules in the examples I gave you.
- Be sure to format your response like the example equivalence rules I gave you.
- Put <New Rule></New Rule> around the new equivalence rule that you think of. Do not use other formatting around the equivalent queries.
- Use GENERALIZED COLUMN AND TABLE NAMES in any EQUIVALENCE RULE YOU WRITE. DO NOT USE THE SAME NAMES IN THE PROVIDED QUERY PAIRS!!!!
- If the two queries are not logically equivalent, say <New Rule> Not equivalent </New Rule>.
- If the new equivalence rule is already repeated in the examples listed, say <New Rule> Rule exists </New Rule>.
- The new rule should be be MINIMAL to CLEARLY demonstrate the highlighted semantic difference. Use ellipses to shorten SQL queries where necessary to achieve this.

Take a Deep Breath and Carefully Follow the Rules, Guides and Examples I gave you. I will tip you $2000 if you do EVERYTHING Perfectly.

The relevant column is:\n- `CreationDate` of type `DATE`, which may contain date values formatted as 'YYYY-MM-DD'.\n\n### Step 2: Parse and Break Down Each Query\n\n**Gold SQL Query:**\n```sql\nSELECT CAST(SUM(IIF(STRFTIME('%Y', CreationDate) = '2010', 1, 0)) AS REAL) / SUM(IIF(STRFTIME('%Y', CreationDate) = '2011', 1, 0)) FROM votes;\n```\n- **Selected Columns/Expressions:** \n  - `CAST(SUM(IIF(STRFTIME('%Y', CreationDate) = '2010', 1, 0)) AS REAL) / SUM(IIF(STRFTIME('%Y', CreationDate) = '2011', 1, 0))`\n- **Functions Used:**\n  - `STRFTIME('%Y', CreationDate)` extracts the year from `CreationDate`.\n  - `IIF(condition, 1, 0)` returns `1` if the condition is true, otherwise `0`.\n  - `SUM()` aggregates the values.\n  - `CAST(... AS REAL)` casts the result to a real number.\n- **Tables Involved:** `votes`\n\n**Machine-generated SQL Query:**\n```sql\nSELECT cast(sum(CASE WHEN votes.creationdate LIKE '2010%' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS REAL) / sum(CASE WHEN votes.creationdate LIKE '2011%' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) FROM votes;\n```\n- **Selected Columns/Expressions:** \n  - `cast(sum(CASE WHEN votes.creationdate LIKE '2010%' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS REAL) / sum(CASE WHEN votes.creationdate LIKE '2011%' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END)`\n- **Functions Used:**\n  - `votes.creationdate LIKE '2010%'` checks if `CreationDate` starts with '2010'.\n  - `CASE WHEN ... THEN 1 ELSE 0 END` is similar to `IIF`.\n  - `SUM()` aggregates the values.\n  - `cast(... AS REAL)` casts the result to a real number.\n- **Tables Involved:** `votes`\n\n### Step 3: Compare Query Components\n- Both queries operate on the `votes` table.\n- Both queries attempt to count occurrences of dates in the years 2010 and 2011.\n- Both queries use aggregate functions and casting to real numbers.\n\n### Step 4: Consider Edge Cases and Data Variations\n- The `STRFTIME('%Y', CreationDate)` and `CreationDate LIKE 'YYYY%'` are logically equivalent for extracting the year from a `DATE` type formatted as 'YYYY-MM-DD'.\n- Both methods should handle edge cases like NULL values similarly, assuming `CreationDate` is consistently formatted.\n\n### Step 5: Evaluate Aggregations and Calculations\n- Both queries use `SUM()` to count occurrences, which is consistent across both queries.\n- The division and casting operations are identical.\n\n### Step 6: Check for Logical Equivalence in Conditional Expressions\n- `IIF(condition, 1, 0)` and `CASE WHEN condition THEN 1 ELSE 0 END` are logically equivalent for conditional counting.\n\n### Step 7: Assess Ordering of Results\n- There is no `ORDER BY` clause, so order does not affect equivalence.\n\n### Step 8: Generate a New Logical Equivalence Rule (If Applicable)\nSince the queries use different methods (`STRFTIME` vs `LIKE`) to extract the year, but these methods are logically equivalent for a `DATE` formatted as 'YYYY-MM-DD', a new rule can be generated.\n\n<New Rule>\nEquivalent Queries:\nSELECT CAST(SUM(IIF(STRFTIME('%Y', date_col) = 'YYYY', 1, 0)) AS REAL) / SUM(IIF(STRFTIME('%Y', date_col) = 'YYYY', 1, 0)) FROM table;\nSELECT CAST(SUM(CASE WHEN date_col LIKE 'YYYY%' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS REAL) / SUM(CASE WHEN date_col LIKE 'YYYY%' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) FROM table;\nSchema Conditions:\ndate_col is of type DATE and formatted as 'YYYY-MM-DD'.\n", role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None, refusal=None))], created=1730778927, model='gpt-4o-2024-08-06', object='chat.completion', system_fingerprint='fp_45cf54deae', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=921, prompt_tokens=3518, total_tokens=4439, prompt_tokens_details={'cached_tokens': 0}, completion_tokens_details={'reasoning_tokens': 0, 'accepted_prediction_tokens': 0, 'rejected_prediction_tokens': 0}))

INFO:root:model: gpt-4o
INFO:root:prompt: You are an expert SQL engineer with 20+ years of experience. You will be given some SQL equivalence rules conditional on some database schemas. You will then be given a pair of SQL queries, consisting of a gold query and a machine-generated query, and a database schema that defines the context of the queries. 

Your task is to compare the two provided SQL queries on logical equivalence and generate one more equivalence rule in the same format as the provided example equivalence rules.

Please make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please also keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.



Evaluation Criteria:

Logical equivalence - the alignment between the gold SQL query and the machine-generated SQL query. A machine-generated SQL query is logically equivalent to the gold query if these two queries would RETURN THE SAME RESULTS AND IN THE SAME ORDER for ALL POSSIBLE DATABASE INSTANCES that satisfy the provided database schema for these queries. Annotators were asked to penalize machine-generated queries that overlooked edge cases that the gold queries would have caught otherwise.



Evaluation steps:

1. Understand the Database Schema: Identify all tables used in both queries. List all columns referenced, along with their data types and constraints. Determine primary and foreign key relationships. Note any indexes or unique constraints that may affect query execution.
2. Parse and Break Down Each Query: Identify selected columns, functions, and expressions. Note the tables involved and the join conditions. Understand the filtering conditions applied. Identify grouping and aggregate conditions, if any. Determine if result ordering affects equivalence.
3. Compare Query Components: Check if both queries use the same tables and join conditions. Compare filtering conditions in the WHERE clauses. Assess whether the same columns and expressions are selected. Identify if different functions or syntaxes achieve the same result. Look for logical equivalence in expressions and calculations.
4. Consider Edge Cases and Data Variations: Conceptualize sample datasets that include edge cases (e.g., NULL values, zero values, special characters). Analyze how each query handles these edge cases. Ensure that data type differences do not affect the outcome. Verify that constraints (e.g., NOT NULL, UNIQUE) are accounted for.
5. Evaluate Aggregations and Calculations: Confirm that aggregate functions (e.g., SUM, COUNT) are applied identically. Ensure calculations (e.g., subtraction, addition) produce the same results.
6. Check for Logical Equivalence in Conditional Expressions: Compare conditional expressions like IIF, CASE WHEN, and IF. Determine if conditions and returned values are logically the same.
7. Assess Ordering of Results: If ORDER BY clause is present, confirm that both queries order results identically. Recognize that differing order may affect equivalence if result order is significant.
8. Generate a New Logical Equivalence Rule (If Applicable): Create an "Equivalent Queries: <query1>
<query2>
Schema Conditions:<conditions>" statement that defines the equivalence. Use GENERALIZED COLUMN and TABLE NAMES. Specify any necessary conditions based on the database schema. Present the rule clearly, indicating both the equivalence and the conditions under which it holds.

# Guidelines:
- Make SURE complete to every step PERFECTLY without ANY Mistakes
- Follow the Rules I Gave you and Remember to AVOID generating repeated equivalence rules in the examples I gave you.
- Be sure to format your response like the example equivalence rules I gave you.
- Put <New Rule></New Rule> around the new equivalence rule that you think of. Do not use other formatting around the equivalent queries.
- Use GENERALIZED COLUMN AND TABLE NAMES in any EQUIVALENCE RULE YOU WRITE. DO NOT USE THE SAME NAMES IN THE PROVIDED QUERY PAIRS!!!!
- If the two queries are not logically equivalent, say <New Rule> Not equivalent </New Rule>.
- If the new equivalence rule is already repeated in the examples listed, say <New Rule> Rule exists </New Rule>.
- The new rule should be be MINIMAL to CLEARLY demonstrate the highlighted semantic difference. Use ellipses to shorten SQL queries where necessary to achieve this.

Take a Deep Breath and Carefully Follow the Rules, Guides and Examples I gave you. I will tip you $2000 if you do EVERYTHING Perfectly.

INFO:root:model: gpt-4o
INFO:root:prompt: You are an expert SQL engineer with 20+ years of experience. You will be given some SQL equivalence rules conditional on some database schemas. You will then be given a pair of SQL queries, consisting of a gold query and a machine-generated query, and a database schema that defines the context of the queries. 

Your task is to compare the two provided SQL queries on logical equivalence and generate one more equivalence rule in the same format as the provided example equivalence rules.

Please make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please also keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.



Evaluation Criteria:

Logical equivalence - the alignment between the gold SQL query and the machine-generated SQL query. A machine-generated SQL query is logically equivalent to the gold query if these two queries would RETURN THE SAME RESULTS AND IN THE SAME ORDER for ALL POSSIBLE DATABASE INSTANCES that satisfy the provided database schema for these queries. Annotators were asked to penalize machine-generated queries that overlooked edge cases that the gold queries would have caught otherwise.



Evaluation steps:

1. Understand the Database Schema: Identify all tables used in both queries. List all columns referenced, along with their data types and constraints. Determine primary and foreign key relationships. Note any indexes or unique constraints that may affect query execution.
2. Parse and Break Down Each Query: Identify selected columns, functions, and expressions. Note the tables involved and the join conditions. Understand the filtering conditions applied. Identify grouping and aggregate conditions, if any. Determine if result ordering affects equivalence.
3. Compare Query Components: Check if both queries use the same tables and join conditions. Compare filtering conditions in the WHERE clauses. Assess whether the same columns and expressions are selected. Identify if different functions or syntaxes achieve the same result. Look for logical equivalence in expressions and calculations.
4. Consider Edge Cases and Data Variations: Conceptualize sample datasets that include edge cases (e.g., NULL values, zero values, special characters). Analyze how each query handles these edge cases. Ensure that data type differences do not affect the outcome. Verify that constraints (e.g., NOT NULL, UNIQUE) are accounted for.
5. Evaluate Aggregations and Calculations: Confirm that aggregate functions (e.g., SUM, COUNT) are applied identically. Ensure calculations (e.g., subtraction, addition) produce the same results.
6. Check for Logical Equivalence in Conditional Expressions: Compare conditional expressions like IIF, CASE WHEN, and IF. Determine if conditions and returned values are logically the same.
7. Assess Ordering of Results: If ORDER BY clause is present, confirm that both queries order results identically. Recognize that differing order may affect equivalence if result order is significant.
8. Generate a New Logical Equivalence Rule (If Applicable): Create an "Equivalent Queries: <query1>
<query2>
Schema Conditions:<conditions>" statement that defines the equivalence. Use GENERALIZED COLUMN and TABLE NAMES. Specify any necessary conditions based on the database schema. Present the rule clearly, indicating both the equivalence and the conditions under which it holds.



Example Equivalence Rules:

<Rule1>

# Guidelines:
- Make SURE complete to every step PERFECTLY without ANY Mistakes
- Follow the Rules I Gave you and Remember to AVOID generating repeated equivalence rules in the examples I gave you.
- Be sure to format your response like the example equivalence rules I gave you.
- Put <New Rule></New Rule> around the new equivalence rule that you think of. Do not use other formatting around the equivalent queries.
- Use GENERALIZED COLUMN AND TABLE NAMES in any EQUIVALENCE RULE YOU WRITE. DO NOT USE THE SAME NAMES IN THE PROVIDED QUERY PAIRS!!!!
- If the two queries are not logically equivalent, say <New Rule> Not equivalent </New Rule>.
- If the new equivalence rule is already repeated in the examples listed, say <New Rule> Rule exists </New Rule>.
- The new rule should be be MINIMAL to CLEARLY demonstrate the highlighted semantic difference. Use ellipses to shorten SQL queries where necessary to achieve this.

Take a Deep Breath and Carefully Follow the Rules, Guides and Examples I gave you. I will tip you $2000 if you do EVERYTHING Perfectly.

INFO:root:model: gpt-4o
INFO:root:prompt: You are an expert SQL engineer with 20+ years of experience. You will be given some SQL equivalence rules conditional on some database schemas. You will then be given a pair of SQL queries, consisting of a gold query and a machine-generated query, and a database schema that defines the context of the queries. 

Your task is to compare the two provided SQL queries on logical equivalence and generate one more equivalence rule in the same format as the provided example equivalence rules.

Please make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please also keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.



Evaluation Criteria:

Logical equivalence - the alignment between the gold SQL query and the machine-generated SQL query. A machine-generated SQL query is logically equivalent to the gold query if these two queries would RETURN THE SAME RESULTS AND IN THE SAME ORDER for ALL POSSIBLE DATABASE INSTANCES that satisfy the provided database schema for these queries. Annotators were asked to penalize machine-generated queries that overlooked edge cases that the gold queries would have caught otherwise.



Evaluation steps:

1. Understand the Database Schema: Identify all tables used in both queries. List all columns referenced, along with their data types and constraints. Determine primary and foreign key relationships. Note any indexes or unique constraints that may affect query execution.
2. Parse and Break Down Each Query: Identify selected columns, functions, and expressions. Note the tables involved and the join conditions. Understand the filtering conditions applied. Identify grouping and aggregate conditions, if any. Determine if result ordering affects equivalence.
3. Compare Query Components: Check if both queries use the same tables and join conditions. Compare filtering conditions in the WHERE clauses. Assess whether the same columns and expressions are selected. Identify if different functions or syntaxes achieve the same result. Look for logical equivalence in expressions and calculations.
4. Consider Edge Cases and Data Variations: Conceptualize sample datasets that include edge cases (e.g., NULL values, zero values, special characters). Analyze how each query handles these edge cases. Ensure that data type differences do not affect the outcome. Verify that constraints (e.g., NOT NULL, UNIQUE) are accounted for.
5. Evaluate Aggregations and Calculations: Confirm that aggregate functions (e.g., SUM, COUNT) are applied identically. Ensure calculations (e.g., subtraction, addition) produce the same results.
6. Check for Logical Equivalence in Conditional Expressions: Compare conditional expressions like IIF, CASE WHEN, and IF. Determine if conditions and returned values are logically the same.
7. Assess Ordering of Results: If ORDER BY clause is present, confirm that both queries order results identically. Recognize that differing order may affect equivalence if result order is significant.
8. Generate a New Logical Equivalence Rule (If Applicable): Create an "Equivalent Queries: <query1>
<query2>
Schema Conditions:<conditions>" statement that defines the equivalence. Use GENERALIZED COLUMN and TABLE NAMES. Specify any necessary conditions based on the database schema. Present the rule clearly, indicating both the equivalence and the conditions under which it holds.



Example Equivalence Rules:

<Rule1>
Equivalent Queries:
SELECT CAST(SUM(IIF(condition, 1, 0)) AS FLOAT) / SUM(IIF(condition, 1, 0)) FROM table;

# Guidelines:
- Make SURE complete to every step PERFECTLY without ANY Mistakes
- Follow the Rules I Gave you and Remember to AVOID generating repeated equivalence rules in the examples I gave you.
- Be sure to format your response like the example equivalence rules I gave you.
- Put <New Rule></New Rule> around the new equivalence rule that you think of. Do not use other formatting around the equivalent queries.
- Use GENERALIZED COLUMN AND TABLE NAMES in any EQUIVALENCE RULE YOU WRITE. DO NOT USE THE SAME NAMES IN THE PROVIDED QUERY PAIRS!!!!
- If the two queries are not logically equivalent, say <New Rule> Not equivalent </New Rule>.
- If the new equivalence rule is already repeated in the examples listed, say <New Rule> Rule exists </New Rule>.
- The new rule should be be MINIMAL to CLEARLY demonstrate the highlighted semantic difference. Use ellipses to shorten SQL queries where necessary to achieve this.

Take a Deep Breath and Carefully Follow the Rules, Guides and Examples I gave you. I will tip you $2000 if you do EVERYTHING Perfectly.

INFO:root:model: gpt-4o
INFO:root:prompt: You are an expert SQL engineer with 20+ years of experience. You will be given some SQL equivalence rules conditional on some database schemas. You will then be given a pair of SQL queries, consisting of a gold query and a machine-generated query, and a database schema that defines the context of the queries. 

Your task is to compare the two provided SQL queries on logical equivalence and generate one more equivalence rule in the same format as the provided example equivalence rules.

Please make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please also keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.



Evaluation Criteria:

Logical equivalence - the alignment between the gold SQL query and the machine-generated SQL query. A machine-generated SQL query is logically equivalent to the gold query if these two queries would RETURN THE SAME RESULTS AND IN THE SAME ORDER for ALL POSSIBLE DATABASE INSTANCES that satisfy the provided database schema for these queries. Annotators were asked to penalize machine-generated queries that overlooked edge cases that the gold queries would have caught otherwise.



Evaluation steps:

1. Understand the Database Schema: Identify all tables used in both queries. List all columns referenced, along with their data types and constraints. Determine primary and foreign key relationships. Note any indexes or unique constraints that may affect query execution.
2. Parse and Break Down Each Query: Identify selected columns, functions, and expressions. Note the tables involved and the join conditions. Understand the filtering conditions applied. Identify grouping and aggregate conditions, if any. Determine if result ordering affects equivalence.
3. Compare Query Components: Check if both queries use the same tables and join conditions. Compare filtering conditions in the WHERE clauses. Assess whether the same columns and expressions are selected. Identify if different functions or syntaxes achieve the same result. Look for logical equivalence in expressions and calculations.
4. Consider Edge Cases and Data Variations: Conceptualize sample datasets that include edge cases (e.g., NULL values, zero values, special characters). Analyze how each query handles these edge cases. Ensure that data type differences do not affect the outcome. Verify that constraints (e.g., NOT NULL, UNIQUE) are accounted for.
5. Evaluate Aggregations and Calculations: Confirm that aggregate functions (e.g., SUM, COUNT) are applied identically. Ensure calculations (e.g., subtraction, addition) produce the same results.
6. Check for Logical Equivalence in Conditional Expressions: Compare conditional expressions like IIF, CASE WHEN, and IF. Determine if conditions and returned values are logically the same.
7. Assess Ordering of Results: If ORDER BY clause is present, confirm that both queries order results identically. Recognize that differing order may affect equivalence if result order is significant.
8. Generate a New Logical Equivalence Rule (If Applicable): Create an "Equivalent Queries: <query1>
<query2>
Schema Conditions:<conditions>" statement that defines the equivalence. Use GENERALIZED COLUMN and TABLE NAMES. Specify any necessary conditions based on the database schema. Present the rule clearly, indicating both the equivalence and the conditions under which it holds.



Example Equivalence Rules:

<Rule1>
Equivalent Queries:
SELECT CAST(SUM(IIF(condition, 1, 0)) AS FLOAT) / SUM(IIF(condition, 1, 0)) FROM table;
SELECT CAST(SUM(CASE WHEN condition THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS REAL) / SUM(CASE WHEN condition THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) FROM table;
Schema Conditions:
None.
</Rule1>

<Rule2>
Equivalent Queries:
SELECT T2.col2 FROM table1 AS T1 INNER JOIN table2 AS T2 ON T1.col1 = T2.col1 WHERE T1.col3 = 'value1' AND T1.col4 = 'value2';
SELECT table2.col2 FROM table2 INNER JOIN table1 ON table2.col1 = table1.col1 WHERE table1.col3 = 'value1' AND table1.col4 = 'value2';
Schema Conditions:
table1.col1 is a foreign key referencing table2.col1, and table2.col1 is a primary key.
</Rule2>

<Rule3>
Equivalent Queries:
SELECT COUNT(table1.col1) FROM table1 INNER JOIN table2 ON table1.col1 = table2.col2 INNER JOIN table3 ON table2.col3 = table3.col4 WHERE table1.condition1 = 'value' AND table3.condition2 = 'value';
SELECT COUNT(table3.col4) FROM table3 INNER JOIN table2 ON table3.col4 = table2.col3 INNER JOIN table1 ON table2.col2 = table1.col1 WHERE table1.condition1 = 'value' AND table3.condition2 = 'value';
Schema Conditions:
table1.col1 is a primary key, table3.col4 is a primary key, and table2.col2 and table2.col3 are foreign keys referencing table1.col1 and table3.col4 respectively.
</Rule3>

<Rule4>
Equivalent Queries:
SELECT COUNT(primary_key_col) FROM table WHERE condition1 AND column = (SELECT MAX(column) FROM table);
SELECT COUNT(foreign_key_col) FROM table WHERE condition1 AND column = (SELECT MAX(column) FROM table);
Schema Conditions:
foreign_key_col is a non-nullable foreign key.
</Rule4>

<Rule5>

# Guidelines:
- Make SURE complete to every step PERFECTLY without ANY Mistakes
- Follow the Rules I Gave you and Remember to AVOID generating repeated equivalence rules in the examples I gave you.
- Be sure to format your response like the example equivalence rules I gave you.
- Put <New Rule></New Rule> around the new equivalence rule that you think of. Do not use other formatting around the equivalent queries.
- Use GENERALIZED COLUMN AND TABLE NAMES in any EQUIVALENCE RULE YOU WRITE. DO NOT USE THE SAME NAMES IN THE PROVIDED QUERY PAIRS!!!!
- If the two queries are not logically equivalent, say <New Rule> Not equivalent </New Rule>.
- If the new equivalence rule is already repeated in the examples listed, say <New Rule> Rule exists </New Rule>.
- The new rule should be be MINIMAL to CLEARLY demonstrate the highlighted semantic difference. Use ellipses to shorten SQL queries where necessary to achieve this.

Take a Deep Breath and Carefully Follow the Rules, Guides and Examples I gave you. I will tip you $2000 if you do EVERYTHING Perfectly.

INFO:root:model: gpt-4o
INFO:root:prompt: You are an expert SQL engineer with 20+ years of experience. You will be given some SQL equivalence rules conditional on some database schemas. You will then be given a pair of SQL queries, consisting of a gold query and a machine-generated query, and a database schema that defines the context of the queries. 

Your task is to compare the two provided SQL queries on logical equivalence and generate one more equivalence rule in the same format as the provided example equivalence rules.

Please make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please also keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.



Evaluation Criteria:

Logical equivalence - the alignment between the gold SQL query and the machine-generated SQL query. A machine-generated SQL query is logically equivalent to the gold query if these two queries would RETURN THE SAME RESULTS AND IN THE SAME ORDER for ALL POSSIBLE DATABASE INSTANCES that satisfy the provided database schema for these queries. Annotators were asked to penalize machine-generated queries that overlooked edge cases that the gold queries would have caught otherwise.



Evaluation steps:

1. Understand the Database Schema: Identify all tables used in both queries. List all columns referenced, along with their data types and constraints. Determine primary and foreign key relationships. Note any indexes or unique constraints that may affect query execution.
2. Parse and Break Down Each Query: Identify selected columns, functions, and expressions. Note the tables involved and the join conditions. Understand the filtering conditions applied. Identify grouping and aggregate conditions, if any. Determine if result ordering affects equivalence.
3. Compare Query Components: Check if both queries use the same tables and join conditions. Compare filtering conditions in the WHERE clauses. Assess whether the same columns and expressions are selected. Identify if different functions or syntaxes achieve the same result. Look for logical equivalence in expressions and calculations.
4. Consider Edge Cases and Data Variations: Conceptualize sample datasets that include edge cases (e.g., NULL values, zero values, special characters). Analyze how each query handles these edge cases. Ensure that data type differences do not affect the outcome. Verify that constraints (e.g., NOT NULL, UNIQUE) are accounted for.
5. Evaluate Aggregations and Calculations: Confirm that aggregate functions (e.g., SUM, COUNT) are applied identically. Ensure calculations (e.g., subtraction, addition) produce the same results.
6. Check for Logical Equivalence in Conditional Expressions: Compare conditional expressions like IIF, CASE WHEN, and IF. Determine if conditions and returned values are logically the same.
7. Assess Ordering of Results: If ORDER BY clause is present, confirm that both queries order results identically. Recognize that differing order may affect equivalence if result order is significant.
8. Generate a New Logical Equivalence Rule (If Applicable): Create an "Equivalent Queries: <query1>
<query2>
Schema Conditions:<conditions>" statement that defines the equivalence. Use GENERALIZED COLUMN and TABLE NAMES. Specify any necessary conditions based on the database schema. Present the rule clearly, indicating both the equivalence and the conditions under which it holds.



Example Equivalence Rules:

<Rule1>
Equivalent Queries:
SELECT CAST(COUNT(CASE WHEN t1.col1 = 'value' THEN t2.col2 END) AS REAL) * 100 / COUNT(t2.col2) FROM table1 AS t1 INNER JOIN table2 AS t2 ON t2.col2 = t1.col2 WHERE t2.col3 = 'value';
SELECT CAST(SUM(CASE WHEN table1.col1 = 'value' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS REAL) * 100 / COUNT(table2.col2) FROM table2 INNER JOIN table1 ON table2.col2 = table1.col2 WHERE table2.col3 = 'value';

# Guidelines:
- Make SURE complete to every step PERFECTLY without ANY Mistakes
- Follow the Rules I Gave you and Remember to AVOID generating repeated equivalence rules in the examples I gave you.
- Be sure to format your response like the example equivalence rules I gave you.
- Put <New Rule></New Rule> around the new equivalence rule that you think of. Do not use other formatting around the equivalent queries.
- Use GENERALIZED COLUMN AND TABLE NAMES in any EQUIVALENCE RULE YOU WRITE. DO NOT USE THE SAME NAMES IN THE PROVIDED QUERY PAIRS!!!!
- If the two queries are not logically equivalent, say <New Rule> Not equivalent </New Rule>.
- If the new equivalence rule is already repeated in the examples listed, say <New Rule> Rule exists </New Rule>.
- The new rule should be be MINIMAL to CLEARLY demonstrate the highlighted semantic difference. Use ellipses to shorten SQL queries where necessary to achieve this.

Take a Deep Breath and Carefully Follow the Rules, Guides and Examples I gave you. I will tip you $2000 if you do EVERYTHING Perfectly.

The gold query uses a join with grouping and ordering, while the machine-generated query uses a subquery to achieve the same result.

INFO:root:model: gpt-4o
INFO:root:prompt: You are an expert SQL engineer with 20+ years of experience. You will be given some SQL equivalence rules conditional on some database schemas. You will then be given a pair of SQL queries, consisting of a gold query and a machine-generated query, and a database schema that defines the context of the queries. 

Your task is to compare the two provided SQL queries on logical equivalence and generate one more equivalence rule in the same format as the provided example equivalence rules.

Please make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please also keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.



Evaluation Criteria:

Logical equivalence - the alignment between the gold SQL query and the machine-generated SQL query. A machine-generated SQL query is logically equivalent to the gold query if these two queries would RETURN THE SAME RESULTS AND IN THE SAME ORDER for ALL POSSIBLE DATABASE INSTANCES that satisfy the provided database schema for these queries. Annotators were asked to penalize machine-generated queries that overlooked edge cases that the gold queries would have caught otherwise.



Evaluation steps:

1. Understand the Database Schema: Identify all tables used in both queries. List all columns referenced, along with their data types and constraints. Determine primary and foreign key relationships. Note any indexes or unique constraints that may affect query execution.
2. Parse and Break Down Each Query: Identify selected columns, functions, and expressions. Note the tables involved and the join conditions. Understand the filtering conditions applied. Identify grouping and aggregate conditions, if any. Determine if result ordering affects equivalence.
3. Compare Query Components: Check if both queries use the same tables and join conditions. Compare filtering conditions in the WHERE clauses. Assess whether the same columns and expressions are selected. Identify if different functions or syntaxes achieve the same result. Look for logical equivalence in expressions and calculations.
4. Consider Edge Cases and Data Variations: Conceptualize sample datasets that include edge cases (e.g., NULL values, zero values, special characters). Analyze how each query handles these edge cases. Ensure that data type differences do not affect the outcome. Verify that constraints (e.g., NOT NULL, UNIQUE) are accounted for.
5. Evaluate Aggregations and Calculations: Confirm that aggregate functions (e.g., SUM, COUNT) are applied identically. Ensure calculations (e.g., subtraction, addition) produce the same results.
6. Check for Logical Equivalence in Conditional Expressions: Compare conditional expressions like IIF, CASE WHEN, and IF. Determine if conditions and returned values are logically the same.
7. Assess Ordering of Results: If ORDER BY clause is present, confirm that both queries order results identically. Recognize that differing order may affect equivalence if result order is significant.
8. Generate a New Logical Equivalence Rule (If Applicable): Create an "Equivalent Queries: <query1>
<query2>
Schema Conditions:<conditions>" statement that defines the equivalence. Use GENERALIZED COLUMN and TABLE NAMES. Specify any necessary conditions based on the database schema. Present the rule clearly, indicating both the equivalence and the conditions under which it holds.



Example Equivalence Rules:

# Guidelines:
- Make SURE complete to every step PERFECTLY without ANY Mistakes
- Follow the Rules I Gave you and Remember to AVOID generating repeated equivalence rules in the examples I gave you.
- Be sure to format your response like the example equivalence rules I gave you.
- Put <New Rule></New Rule> around the new equivalence rule that you think of. Do not use other formatting around the equivalent queries.
- Use GENERALIZED COLUMN AND TABLE NAMES in any EQUIVALENCE RULE YOU WRITE. DO NOT USE THE SAME NAMES IN THE PROVIDED QUERY PAIRS!!!!
- If the two queries are not logically equivalent, say <New Rule> Not equivalent </New Rule>.
- If the new equivalence rule is already repeated in the examples listed, say <New Rule> Rule exists </New Rule>.
- The new rule should be be MINIMAL to CLEARLY demonstrate the highlighted semantic difference. Use ellipses to shorten SQL queries where necessary to achieve this.

Take a Deep Breath and Carefully Follow the Rules, Guides and Examples I gave you. I will tip you $2000 if you do EVERYTHING Perfectly.

INFO:root:model: gpt-4o
INFO:root:prompt: You are an expert SQL engineer with 20+ years of experience. You will be given some SQL equivalence rules conditional on some database schemas. You will then be given a pair of SQL queries, consisting of a gold query and a machine-generated query, and a database schema that defines the context of the queries. 

Your task is to compare the two provided SQL queries on logical equivalence and generate one more equivalence rule in the same format as the provided example equivalence rules.

Please make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please also keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.



Evaluation Criteria:

Logical equivalence - the alignment between the gold SQL query and the machine-generated SQL query. A machine-generated SQL query is logically equivalent to the gold query if these two queries would RETURN THE SAME RESULTS AND IN THE SAME ORDER for ALL POSSIBLE DATABASE INSTANCES that satisfy the provided database schema for these queries. Annotators were asked to penalize machine-generated queries that overlooked edge cases that the gold queries would have caught otherwise.



Evaluation steps:

1. Understand the Database Schema: Identify all tables used in both queries. List all columns referenced, along with their data types and constraints. Determine primary and foreign key relationships. Note any indexes or unique constraints that may affect query execution.
2. Parse and Break Down Each Query: Identify selected columns, functions, and expressions. Note the tables involved and the join conditions. Understand the filtering conditions applied. Identify grouping and aggregate conditions, if any. Determine if result ordering affects equivalence.
3. Compare Query Components: Check if both queries use the same tables and join conditions. Compare filtering conditions in the WHERE clauses. Assess whether the same columns and expressions are selected. Identify if different functions or syntaxes achieve the same result. Look for logical equivalence in expressions and calculations.
4. Consider Edge Cases and Data Variations: Conceptualize sample datasets that include edge cases (e.g., NULL values, zero values, special characters). Analyze how each query handles these edge cases. Ensure that data type differences do not affect the outcome. Verify that constraints (e.g., NOT NULL, UNIQUE) are accounted for.
5. Evaluate Aggregations and Calculations: Confirm that aggregate functions (e.g., SUM, COUNT) are applied identically. Ensure calculations (e.g., subtraction, addition) produce the same results.
6. Check for Logical Equivalence in Conditional Expressions: Compare conditional expressions like IIF, CASE WHEN, and IF. Determine if conditions and returned values are logically the same.
7. Assess Ordering of Results: If ORDER BY clause is present, confirm that both queries order results identically. Recognize that differing order may affect equivalence if result order is significant.
8. Generate a New Logical Equivalence Rule (If Applicable): Create an "Equivalent Queries: <query1>
<query2>
Schema Conditions:<conditions>" statement that defines the equivalence. Use GENERALIZED COLUMN and TABLE NAMES. Specify any necessary conditions based on the database schema. Present the rule clearly, indicating both the equivalence and the conditions under which it holds.



Example Equivalence Rules:

<Rule1>
Equivalent Queries:
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM table1 INNER JOIN table2 ON table1.col1 = table2.col2 WHERE condition;

# Guidelines:
- Make SURE complete to every step PERFECTLY without ANY Mistakes
- Follow the Rules I Gave you and Remember to AVOID generating repeated equivalence rules in the examples I gave you.
- Be sure to format your response like the example equivalence rules I gave you.
- Put <New Rule></New Rule> around the new equivalence rule that you think of. Do not use other formatting around the equivalent queries.
- Use GENERALIZED COLUMN AND TABLE NAMES in any EQUIVALENCE RULE YOU WRITE. DO NOT USE THE SAME NAMES IN THE PROVIDED QUERY PAIRS!!!!
- If the two queries are not logically equivalent, say <New Rule> Not equivalent </New Rule>.
- If the new equivalence rule is already repeated in the examples listed, say <New Rule> Rule exists </New Rule>.
- The new rule should be be MINIMAL to CLEARLY demonstrate the highlighted semantic difference. Use ellipses to shorten SQL queries where necessary to achieve this.

Take a Deep Breath and Carefully Follow the Rules, Guides and Examples I gave you. I will tip you $2000 if you do EVERYTHING Perfectly.

INFO:root:model: gpt-4o
INFO:root:prompt: You are an expert SQL engineer with 20+ years of experience. You will be given some SQL equivalence rules conditional on some database schemas. You will then be given a pair of SQL queries, consisting of a gold query and a machine-generated query, and a database schema that defines the context of the queries. 

Your task is to compare the two provided SQL queries on logical equivalence and generate one more equivalence rule in the same format as the provided example equivalence rules.

Please make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please also keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.



Evaluation Criteria:

Logical equivalence - the alignment between the gold SQL query and the machine-generated SQL query. A machine-generated SQL query is logically equivalent to the gold query if these two queries would RETURN THE SAME RESULTS AND IN THE SAME ORDER for ALL POSSIBLE DATABASE INSTANCES that satisfy the provided database schema for these queries. Annotators were asked to penalize machine-generated queries that overlooked edge cases that the gold queries would have caught otherwise.



Evaluation steps:

1. Understand the Database Schema: Identify all tables used in both queries. List all columns referenced, along with their data types and constraints. Determine primary and foreign key relationships. Note any indexes or unique constraints that may affect query execution.
2. Parse and Break Down Each Query: Identify selected columns, functions, and expressions. Note the tables involved and the join conditions. Understand the filtering conditions applied. Identify grouping and aggregate conditions, if any. Determine if result ordering affects equivalence.
3. Compare Query Components: Check if both queries use the same tables and join conditions. Compare filtering conditions in the WHERE clauses. Assess whether the same columns and expressions are selected. Identify if different functions or syntaxes achieve the same result. Look for logical equivalence in expressions and calculations.
4. Consider Edge Cases and Data Variations: Conceptualize sample datasets that include edge cases (e.g., NULL values, zero values, special characters). Analyze how each query handles these edge cases. Ensure that data type differences do not affect the outcome. Verify that constraints (e.g., NOT NULL, UNIQUE) are accounted for.
5. Evaluate Aggregations and Calculations: Confirm that aggregate functions (e.g., SUM, COUNT) are applied identically. Ensure calculations (e.g., subtraction, addition) produce the same results.
6. Check for Logical Equivalence in Conditional Expressions: Compare conditional expressions like IIF, CASE WHEN, and IF. Determine if conditions and returned values are logically the same.
7. Assess Ordering of Results: If ORDER BY clause is present, confirm that both queries order results identically. Recognize that differing order may affect equivalence if result order is significant.
8. Generate a New Logical Equivalence Rule (If Applicable): Create an "Equivalent Queries: <query1>
<query2>
Schema Conditions:<conditions>" statement that defines the equivalence. Use GENERALIZED COLUMN and TABLE NAMES. Specify any necessary conditions based on the database schema. Present the rule clearly, indicating both the equivalence and the conditions under which it holds.



Example Equivalence Rules:

# Guidelines:
- Make SURE complete to every step PERFECTLY without ANY Mistakes
- Follow the Rules I Gave you and Remember to AVOID generating repeated equivalence rules in the examples I gave you.
- Be sure to format your response like the example equivalence rules I gave you.
- Put <New Rule></New Rule> around the new equivalence rule that you think of. Do not use other formatting around the equivalent queries.
- Use GENERALIZED COLUMN AND TABLE NAMES in any EQUIVALENCE RULE YOU WRITE. DO NOT USE THE SAME NAMES IN THE PROVIDED QUERY PAIRS!!!!
- If the two queries are not logically equivalent, say <New Rule> Not equivalent </New Rule>.
- If the new equivalence rule is already repeated in the examples listed, say <New Rule> Rule exists </New Rule>.
- The new rule should be be MINIMAL to CLEARLY demonstrate the highlighted semantic difference. Use ellipses to shorten SQL queries where necessary to achieve this.

Take a Deep Breath and Carefully Follow the Rules, Guides and Examples I gave you. I will tip you $2000 if you do EVERYTHING Perfectly.

Given that `id` is a non-nullable primary key in `cards`, `COUNT(T1.id)` is equivalent to `COUNT(*)` when considering rows where `cards.isStorySpotlight = 1`.\n\n### Step 4: Consider Edge Cases and Data Variations\n\n- **Data Type Differences**: Both queries cast the sum to `REAL`, ensuring consistent data types in the result.\n- **Constraints**: `uuid` is a unique identifier, ensuring a one-to-one relationship between joined records.\n\n### Step 5: Evaluate Aggregations and Calculations\n\n- Both queries apply aggregation functions similarly, and the use of `COUNT(*)` vs. `COUNT(T1.id)` does not affect the result due to the non-nullable nature of `id`.\n\n### Step 6: Check for Logical Equivalence in Conditional Expressions\n\n- Both queries use `CASE WHEN` to count French language entries, which is logically equivalent.\n\n### Step 7: Assess Ordering of Results\n\n- Neither query specifies an `ORDER BY` clause, so result ordering is not a factor.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBoth queries are logically equivalent. The main difference is in the use of `COUNT(T1.id)` versus `COUNT(*)`, which is equivalent given the schema constraints.\n\n### Step 8: Generate a New Logical Equivalence Rule\n\n<New Rule>\nEquivalent Queries:\nSELECT CAST(SUM(CASE WHEN T2.col2 = 'value' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS REAL) * 100 / COUNT(T1.pk_col) FROM table1 AS T1 INNER JOIN table2 AS T2 ON T1.col1 = T2.col1 WHERE T1.col3 = 1;\nSELECT CAST(SUM(CASE WHEN table2.col2 = 'value' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS REAL) * 100 / COUNT(*) FROM table1 INNER JOIN table2 ON table1.col1 = table2.col1 WHERE table1.col3 = 1;\nSchema Conditions:\npk_col is a non-nullable primary key in table1.\n", role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None, refusal=None))], created=1730779620, model='gpt-4o-2024-08-06', object='chat.completion', system_fingerprint='fp_45cf54deae', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=848, prompt_tokens=3705, total_tokens=4553, prompt_tokens_details={'cached_tokens': 0}, completion_tokens_details={'reasoning_tokens': 0, 'accepted_prediction_tokens': 0, 'rejected_prediction_tokens': 0}))

INFO:root:model: gpt-4o
INFO:root:prompt: You are an expert SQL engineer with 20+ years of experience. You will be given some SQL equivalence rules conditional on some database schemas. You will then be given a pair of SQL queries, consisting of a gold query and a machine-generated query, and a database schema that defines the context of the queries. 

Your task is to compare the two provided SQL queries on logical equivalence and generate one more equivalence rule in the same format as the provided example equivalence rules.

Please make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please also keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.



Evaluation Criteria:

Logical equivalence - the alignment between the gold SQL query and the machine-generated SQL query. A machine-generated SQL query is logically equivalent to the gold query if these two queries would RETURN THE SAME RESULTS AND IN THE SAME ORDER for ALL POSSIBLE DATABASE INSTANCES that satisfy the provided database schema for these queries. Annotators were asked to penalize machine-generated queries that overlooked edge cases that the gold queries would have caught otherwise.



Evaluation steps:

1. Understand the Database Schema: Identify all tables used in both queries. List all columns referenced, along with their data types and constraints. Determine primary and foreign key relationships. Note any indexes or unique constraints that may affect query execution.
2. Parse and Break Down Each Query: Identify selected columns, functions, and expressions. Note the tables involved and the join conditions. Understand the filtering conditions applied. Identify grouping and aggregate conditions, if any. Determine if result ordering affects equivalence.
3. Compare Query Components: Check if both queries use the same tables and join conditions. Compare filtering conditions in the WHERE clauses. Assess whether the same columns and expressions are selected. Identify if different functions or syntaxes achieve the same result. Look for logical equivalence in expressions and calculations.
4. Consider Edge Cases and Data Variations: Conceptualize sample datasets that include edge cases (e.g., NULL values, zero values, special characters). Analyze how each query handles these edge cases. Ensure that data type differences do not affect the outcome. Verify that constraints (e.g., NOT NULL, UNIQUE) are accounted for.
5. Evaluate Aggregations and Calculations: Confirm that aggregate functions (e.g., SUM, COUNT) are applied identically. Ensure calculations (e.g., subtraction, addition) produce the same results.
6. Check for Logical Equivalence in Conditional Expressions: Compare conditional expressions like IIF, CASE WHEN, and IF. Determine if conditions and returned values are logically the same.
7. Assess Ordering of Results: If ORDER BY clause is present, confirm that both queries order results identically. Recognize that differing order may affect equivalence if result order is significant.
8. Generate a New Logical Equivalence Rule (If Applicable): Create an "Equivalent Queries: <query1>
<query2>
Schema Conditions:<conditions>" statement that defines the equivalence. Use GENERALIZED COLUMN and TABLE NAMES. Specify any necessary conditions based on the database schema. Present the rule clearly, indicating both the equivalence and the conditions under which it holds.



Example Equivalence Rules:

<Rule1>
Equivalent Queries:
SELECT CAST(COUNT(CASE WHEN t1.col1 = 'value' THEN t2.col2 END) AS REAL) * 100 / COUNT(t2.col2) FROM table1 AS t1 INNER JOIN table2 AS t2 ON t2.col2 = t1.col2 WHERE t2.col3 = 'value';
SELECT CAST(SUM(CASE WHEN table1.col1 = 'value' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS REAL) * 100 / COUNT(table2.col2) FROM table2 INNER JOIN table1 ON table2.col2 = table1.col2 WHERE table2.col3 = 'value';

# Guidelines:
- Make SURE complete to every step PERFECTLY without ANY Mistakes
- Follow the Rules I Gave you and Remember to AVOID generating repeated equivalence rules in the examples I gave you.
- Be sure to format your response like the example equivalence rules I gave you.
- Put <New Rule></New Rule> around the new equivalence rule that you think of. Do not use other formatting around the equivalent queries.
- Use GENERALIZED COLUMN AND TABLE NAMES in any EQUIVALENCE RULE YOU WRITE. DO NOT USE THE SAME NAMES IN THE PROVIDED QUERY PAIRS!!!!
- If the two queries are not logically equivalent, say <New Rule> Not equivalent </New Rule>.
- If the new equivalence rule is already repeated in the examples listed, say <New Rule> Rule exists </New Rule>.
- The new rule should be be MINIMAL to CLEARLY demonstrate the highlighted semantic difference. Use ellipses to shorten SQL queries where necessary to achieve this.

Take a Deep Breath and Carefully Follow the Rules, Guides and Examples I gave you. I will tip you $2000 if you do EVERYTHING Perfectly.

INFO:root:model: gpt-4o
INFO:root:prompt: You are an expert SQL engineer with 20+ years of experience. You will be given some SQL equivalence rules conditional on some database schemas. You will then be given a pair of SQL queries, consisting of a gold query and a machine-generated query, and a database schema that defines the context of the queries. 

Your task is to compare the two provided SQL queries on logical equivalence and generate one more equivalence rule in the same format as the provided example equivalence rules.

Please make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please also keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.



Evaluation Criteria:

Logical equivalence - the alignment between the gold SQL query and the machine-generated SQL query. A machine-generated SQL query is logically equivalent to the gold query if these two queries would RETURN THE SAME RESULTS AND IN THE SAME ORDER for ALL POSSIBLE DATABASE INSTANCES that satisfy the provided database schema for these queries. Annotators were asked to penalize machine-generated queries that overlooked edge cases that the gold queries would have caught otherwise.



Evaluation steps:

1. Understand the Database Schema: Identify all tables used in both queries. List all columns referenced, along with their data types and constraints. Determine primary and foreign key relationships. Note any indexes or unique constraints that may affect query execution.
2. Parse and Break Down Each Query: Identify selected columns, functions, and expressions. Note the tables involved and the join conditions. Understand the filtering conditions applied. Identify grouping and aggregate conditions, if any. Determine if result ordering affects equivalence.
3. Compare Query Components: Check if both queries use the same tables and join conditions. Compare filtering conditions in the WHERE clauses. Assess whether the same columns and expressions are selected. Identify if different functions or syntaxes achieve the same result. Look for logical equivalence in expressions and calculations.
4. Consider Edge Cases and Data Variations: Conceptualize sample datasets that include edge cases (e.g., NULL values, zero values, special characters). Analyze how each query handles these edge cases. Ensure that data type differences do not affect the outcome. Verify that constraints (e.g., NOT NULL, UNIQUE) are accounted for.
5. Evaluate Aggregations and Calculations: Confirm that aggregate functions (e.g., SUM, COUNT) are applied identically. Ensure calculations (e.g., subtraction, addition) produce the same results.
6. Check for Logical Equivalence in Conditional Expressions: Compare conditional expressions like IIF, CASE WHEN, and IF. Determine if conditions and returned values are logically the same.
7. Assess Ordering of Results: If ORDER BY clause is present, confirm that both queries order results identically. Recognize that differing order may affect equivalence if result order is significant.
8. Generate a New Logical Equivalence Rule (If Applicable): Create an "Equivalent Queries: <query1>
<query2>
Schema Conditions:<conditions>" statement that defines the equivalence. Use GENERALIZED COLUMN and TABLE NAMES. Specify any necessary conditions based on the database schema. Present the rule clearly, indicating both the equivalence and the conditions under which it holds.



Example Equivalence Rules:

<Rule1>
Equivalent Queries:
SELECT T1.col1, T2.col2 FROM table1 AS T1 INNER JOIN table2 AS T2 ON T1.col3 = T2.col3 WHERE T1.col3 = value;
SELECT table1.col1, table2.col2 FROM table1 INNER JOIN table2 ON table1.col3 = table2.col3 WHERE table1.col3 = value;

Equivalent Queries:
SELECT COUNT(table1.col1) FROM table1 INNER JOIN table2 ON table1.col1 = table2.col2 INNER JOIN table3 ON table2.col3 = table3.col4 WHERE table1.condition1 = 'value' AND table3.condition2 = 'value';
SELECT COUNT(table3.col4) FROM table3 INNER JOIN table2 ON table3.col4 = table2.col3 INNER JOIN table1 ON table2.col2 = table1.col1 WHERE table1.condition1 = 'value' AND table3.condition2 = 'value';
Schema Conditions:
table1.col1 is a primary key, table3.col4 is a primary key, and table2.col2 and table2.col3 are foreign keys referencing table1.col1 and table3.col4 respectively.

# Guidelines:
- Make SURE complete to every step PERFECTLY without ANY Mistakes
- Follow the Rules I Gave you and Remember to AVOID generating repeated equivalence rules in the examples I gave you.
- Be sure to format your response like the example equivalence rules I gave you.
- Put <New Rule></New Rule> around the new equivalence rule that you think of. Do not use other formatting around the equivalent queries.
- Use GENERALIZED COLUMN AND TABLE NAMES in any EQUIVALENCE RULE YOU WRITE. DO NOT USE THE SAME NAMES IN THE PROVIDED QUERY PAIRS!!!!
- If the two queries are not logically equivalent, say <New Rule> Not equivalent </New Rule>.
- If the new equivalence rule is already repeated in the examples listed, say <New Rule> Rule exists </New Rule>.
- The new rule should be be MINIMAL to CLEARLY demonstrate the highlighted semantic difference. Use ellipses to shorten SQL queries where necessary to achieve this.

Take a Deep Breath and Carefully Follow the Rules, Guides and Examples I gave you. I will tip you $2000 if you do EVERYTHING Perfectly.



Pair of SQL Queries:
<Gold SQL Query>
SELECT COUNT(T1.id) FROM sets AS T1 INNER JOIN set_translations AS T2 ON T1.code = T2.setCode WHERE T2.language = 'Portuguese (Brazil)' AND T1.block = 'Commander';
</Gold SQL Query>

<Machine-generated SQL Query>
SELECT count(*) FROM sets INNER JOIN set_translations ON sets.code = set_translations.setcode WHERE sets.block = 'Commander' AND set_translations.language = 'Portuguese (Brazil)';

The rule for equivalence is:\n\n<New Rule>\nEquivalent Queries:\nSELECT COUNT(primary_key_col) FROM table1 INNER JOIN table2 ON table1.foreign_key_col = table2.primary_key_col WHERE condition1 AND condition2;\nSELECT COUNT(*) FROM table1 INNER JOIN table2 ON table1.foreign_key_col = table2.primary_key_col WHERE condition2 AND condition1;\nSchema Conditions:\nprimary_key_col is a primary key in table1.\n", role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None, refusal=None))], created=1730779714, model='gpt-4o-2024-08-06', object='chat.completion', system_fingerprint='fp_45cf54deae', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=581, prompt_tokens=3672, total_tokens=4253, prompt_tokens_details={'cached_tokens': 0}, completion_tokens_details={'reasoning_tokens': 0, 'accepted_prediction_tokens': 0, 'rejected_prediction_tokens': 0}))

Your task is to compare the two provided SQL queries on logical equivalence and generate one more equivalence rule in the same format as the provided example equivalence rules.

Please make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please also keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.



Evaluation Criteria:

Logical equivalence - the alignment between the gold SQL query and the machine-generated SQL query. A machine-generated SQL query is logically equivalent to the gold query if these two queries would RETURN THE SAME RESULTS AND IN THE SAME ORDER for ALL POSSIBLE DATABASE INSTANCES that satisfy the provided database schema for these queries. Annotators were asked to penalize machine-generated queries that overlooked edge cases that the gold queries would have caught otherwise.



Evaluation steps:

1. Understand the Database Schema: Identify all tables used in both queries. List all columns referenced, along with their data types and constraints. Determine primary and foreign key relationships. Note any indexes or unique constraints that may affect query execution.
2. Parse and Break Down Each Query: Identify selected columns, functions, and expressions. Note the tables involved and the join conditions. Understand the filtering conditions applied. Identify grouping and aggregate conditions, if any. Determine if result ordering affects equivalence.
3. Compare Query Components: Check if both queries use the same tables and join conditions. Compare filtering conditions in the WHERE clauses. Assess whether the same columns and expressions are selected. Identify if different functions or syntaxes achieve the same result. Look for logical equivalence in expressions and calculations.
4. Consider Edge Cases and Data Variations: Conceptualize sample datasets that include edge cases (e.g., NULL values, zero values, special characters). Analyze how each query handles these edge cases. Ensure that data type differences do not affect the outcome. Verify that constraints (e.g., NOT NULL, UNIQUE) are accounted for.
5. Evaluate Aggregations and Calculations: Confirm that aggregate functions (e.g., SUM, COUNT) are applied identically. Ensure calculations (e.g., subtraction, addition) produce the same results.
6. Check for Logical Equivalence in Conditional Expressions: Compare conditional expressions like IIF, CASE WHEN, and IF. Determine if conditions and returned values are logically the same.
7. Assess Ordering of Results: If ORDER BY clause is present, confirm that both queries order results identically. Recognize that differing order may affect equivalence if result order is significant.
8. Generate a New Logical Equivalence Rule (If Applicable): Create an "Equivalent Queries: <query1>
<query2>
Schema Conditions:<conditions>" statement that defines the equivalence. Use GENERALIZED COLUMN and TABLE NAMES. Specify any necessary conditions based on the database schema. Present the rule clearly, indicating both the equivalence and the conditions under which it holds.



Example Equivalence Rules:

# Guidelines:
- Make SURE complete to every step PERFECTLY without ANY Mistakes
- Follow the Rules I Gave you and Remember to AVOID generating repeated equivalence rules in the examples I gave you.
- Be sure to format your response like the example equivalence rules I gave you.
- Put <New Rule></New Rule> around the new equivalence rule that you think of. Do not use other formatting around the equivalent queries.
- Use GENERALIZED COLUMN AND TABLE NAMES in any EQUIVALENCE RULE YOU WRITE. DO NOT USE THE SAME NAMES IN THE PROVIDED QUERY PAIRS!!!!
- If the two queries are not logically equivalent, say <New Rule> Not equivalent </New Rule>.
- If the new equivalence rule is already repeated in the examples listed, say <New Rule> Rule exists </New Rule>.
- The new rule should be be MINIMAL to CLEARLY demonstrate the highlighted semantic difference. Use ellipses to shorten SQL queries where necessary to achieve this.

Take a Deep Breath and Carefully Follow the Rules, Guides and Examples I gave you. I will tip you $2000 if you do EVERYTHING Perfectly.

INFO:root:model: gpt-4o
INFO:root:prompt: You are an expert SQL engineer with 20+ years of experience. You will be given some SQL equivalence rules conditional on some database schemas. You will then be given a pair of SQL queries, consisting of a gold query and a machine-generated query, and a database schema that defines the context of the queries. 

Your task is to compare the two provided SQL queries on logical equivalence and generate one more equivalence rule in the same format as the provided example equivalence rules.

Please make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please also keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.



Evaluation Criteria:

Logical equivalence - the alignment between the gold SQL query and the machine-generated SQL query. A machine-generated SQL query is logically equivalent to the gold query if these two queries would RETURN THE SAME RESULTS AND IN THE SAME ORDER for ALL POSSIBLE DATABASE INSTANCES that satisfy the provided database schema for these queries. Annotators were asked to penalize machine-generated queries that overlooked edge cases that the gold queries would have caught otherwise.



Evaluation steps:

1. Understand the Database Schema: Identify all tables used in both queries. List all columns referenced, along with their data types and constraints. Determine primary and foreign key relationships. Note any indexes or unique constraints that may affect query execution.
2. Parse and Break Down Each Query: Identify selected columns, functions, and expressions. Note the tables involved and the join conditions. Understand the filtering conditions applied. Identify grouping and aggregate conditions, if any. Determine if result ordering affects equivalence.
3. Compare Query Components: Check if both queries use the same tables and join conditions. Compare filtering conditions in the WHERE clauses. Assess whether the same columns and expressions are selected. Identify if different functions or syntaxes achieve the same result. Look for logical equivalence in expressions and calculations.
4. Consider Edge Cases and Data Variations: Conceptualize sample datasets that include edge cases (e.g., NULL values, zero values, special characters). Analyze how each query handles these edge cases. Ensure that data type differences do not affect the outcome. Verify that constraints (e.g., NOT NULL, UNIQUE) are accounted for.
5. Evaluate Aggregations and Calculations: Confirm that aggregate functions (e.g., SUM, COUNT) are applied identically. Ensure calculations (e.g., subtraction, addition) produce the same results.
6. Check for Logical Equivalence in Conditional Expressions: Compare conditional expressions like IIF, CASE WHEN, and IF. Determine if conditions and returned values are logically the same.
7. Assess Ordering of Results: If ORDER BY clause is present, confirm that both queries order results identically. Recognize that differing order may affect equivalence if result order is significant.
8. Generate a New Logical Equivalence Rule (If Applicable): Create an "Equivalent Queries: <query1>
<query2>
Schema Conditions:<conditions>" statement that defines the equivalence. Use GENERALIZED COLUMN and TABLE NAMES. Specify any necessary conditions based on the database schema. Present the rule clearly, indicating both the equivalence and the conditions under which it holds.



Example Equivalence Rules:

Equivalent Queries:
SELECT CAST(SUM(column1) AS REAL) / COUNT(column2) FROM table1 INNER JOIN table2 ON table1.col1 = table2.col1 WHERE condition;

# Guidelines:
- Make SURE complete to every step PERFECTLY without ANY Mistakes
- Follow the Rules I Gave you and Remember to AVOID generating repeated equivalence rules in the examples I gave you.
- Be sure to format your response like the example equivalence rules I gave you.
- Put <New Rule></New Rule> around the new equivalence rule that you think of. Do not use other formatting around the equivalent queries.
- Use GENERALIZED COLUMN AND TABLE NAMES in any EQUIVALENCE RULE YOU WRITE. DO NOT USE THE SAME NAMES IN THE PROVIDED QUERY PAIRS!!!!
- If the two queries are not logically equivalent, say <New Rule> Not equivalent </New Rule>.
- If the new equivalence rule is already repeated in the examples listed, say <New Rule> Rule exists </New Rule>.
- The new rule should be be MINIMAL to CLEARLY demonstrate the highlighted semantic difference. Use ellipses to shorten SQL queries where necessary to achieve this.

Take a Deep Breath and Carefully Follow the Rules, Guides and Examples I gave you. I will tip you $2000 if you do EVERYTHING Perfectly.

INFO:root:model: gpt-4o
INFO:root:prompt: You are an expert SQL engineer with 20+ years of experience. You will be given some SQL equivalence rules conditional on some database schemas. You will then be given a pair of SQL queries, consisting of a gold query and a machine-generated query, and a database schema that defines the context of the queries. 

Your task is to compare the two provided SQL queries on logical equivalence and generate one more equivalence rule in the same format as the provided example equivalence rules.

Please make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please also keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.



Evaluation Criteria:

Logical equivalence - the alignment between the gold SQL query and the machine-generated SQL query. A machine-generated SQL query is logically equivalent to the gold query if these two queries would RETURN THE SAME RESULTS AND IN THE SAME ORDER for ALL POSSIBLE DATABASE INSTANCES that satisfy the provided database schema for these queries. Annotators were asked to penalize machine-generated queries that overlooked edge cases that the gold queries would have caught otherwise.



Evaluation steps:

1. Understand the Database Schema: Identify all tables used in both queries. List all columns referenced, along with their data types and constraints. Determine primary and foreign key relationships. Note any indexes or unique constraints that may affect query execution.
2. Parse and Break Down Each Query: Identify selected columns, functions, and expressions. Note the tables involved and the join conditions. Understand the filtering conditions applied. Identify grouping and aggregate conditions, if any. Determine if result ordering affects equivalence.
3. Compare Query Components: Check if both queries use the same tables and join conditions. Compare filtering conditions in the WHERE clauses. Assess whether the same columns and expressions are selected. Identify if different functions or syntaxes achieve the same result. Look for logical equivalence in expressions and calculations.
4. Consider Edge Cases and Data Variations: Conceptualize sample datasets that include edge cases (e.g., NULL values, zero values, special characters). Analyze how each query handles these edge cases. Ensure that data type differences do not affect the outcome. Verify that constraints (e.g., NOT NULL, UNIQUE) are accounted for.
5. Evaluate Aggregations and Calculations: Confirm that aggregate functions (e.g., SUM, COUNT) are applied identically. Ensure calculations (e.g., subtraction, addition) produce the same results.
6. Check for Logical Equivalence in Conditional Expressions: Compare conditional expressions like IIF, CASE WHEN, and IF. Determine if conditions and returned values are logically the same.
7. Assess Ordering of Results: If ORDER BY clause is present, confirm that both queries order results identically. Recognize that differing order may affect equivalence if result order is significant.
8. Generate a New Logical Equivalence Rule (If Applicable): Create an "Equivalent Queries: <query1>
<query2>
Schema Conditions:<conditions>" statement that defines the equivalence. Use GENERALIZED COLUMN and TABLE NAMES. Specify any necessary conditions based on the database schema. Present the rule clearly, indicating both the equivalence and the conditions under which it holds.



Example Equivalence Rules:

<Rule1>
Equivalent Queries:
SELECT CAST(SUM(IIF(condition, 1, 0)) AS FLOAT) / SUM(IIF(condition, 1, 0)) FROM table;

</Rule4>

<Rule5>
Equivalent Queries:

# Guidelines:
- Make SURE complete to every step PERFECTLY without ANY Mistakes
- Follow the Rules I Gave you and Remember to AVOID generating repeated equivalence rules in the examples I gave you.
- Be sure to format your response like the example equivalence rules I gave you.
- Put <New Rule></New Rule> around the new equivalence rule that you think of. Do not use other formatting around the equivalent queries.
- Use GENERALIZED COLUMN AND TABLE NAMES in any EQUIVALENCE RULE YOU WRITE. DO NOT USE THE SAME NAMES IN THE PROVIDED QUERY PAIRS!!!!
- If the two queries are not logically equivalent, say <New Rule> Not equivalent </New Rule>.
- If the new equivalence rule is already repeated in the examples listed, say <New Rule> Rule exists </New Rule>.
- The new rule should be be MINIMAL to CLEARLY demonstrate the highlighted semantic difference. Use ellipses to shorten SQL queries where necessary to achieve this.

Take a Deep Breath and Carefully Follow the Rules, Guides and Examples I gave you. I will tip you $2000 if you do EVERYTHING Perfectly.

SQL is case-insensitive for keywords and identifiers unless the database is set to be case-sensitive.\n- Both queries filter based on the same condition: `multiverseid = 149934`.\n\n**Step 4: Consider Edge Cases and Data Variations**\n\n- The column `language` is of type TEXT, and `multiverseid` is INTEGER. The comparison is straightforward, and there are no special edge cases to consider here.\n\n**Step 5: Evaluate Aggregations and Calculations**\n\n- No aggregations or calculations are involved in these queries.\n\n**Step 6: Check for Logical Equivalence in Conditional Expressions**\n\n- The conditional expressions are identical in both queries.\n\n**Step 7: Assess Ordering of Results**\n\n- There is no `ORDER BY` clause in either query, so result ordering does not affect equivalence.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe two queries are logically equivalent because they perform the same operation and will produce the same results for any database instance that satisfies the schema.\n\n**Step 8: Generate a New Logical Equivalence Rule**\n\nThe difference in the case of the column name does not affect the logical equivalence in a typical SQL environment where identifiers are case-insensitive.

INFO:root:model: gpt-4o
INFO:root:prompt: You are an expert SQL engineer with 20+ years of experience. You will be given some SQL equivalence rules conditional on some database schemas. You will then be given a pair of SQL queries, consisting of a gold query and a machine-generated query, and a database schema that defines the context of the queries. 

Your task is to compare the two provided SQL queries on logical equivalence and generate one more equivalence rule in the same format as the provided example equivalence rules.

Please make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please also keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.



Evaluation Criteria:

Logical equivalence - the alignment between the gold SQL query and the machine-generated SQL query. A machine-generated SQL query is logically equivalent to the gold query if these two queries would RETURN THE SAME RESULTS AND IN THE SAME ORDER for ALL POSSIBLE DATABASE INSTANCES that satisfy the provided database schema for these queries. Annotators were asked to penalize machine-generated queries that overlooked edge cases that the gold queries would have caught otherwise.



Evaluation steps:

1. Understand the Database Schema: Identify all tables used in both queries. List all columns referenced, along with their data types and constraints. Determine primary and foreign key relationships. Note any indexes or unique constraints that may affect query execution.
2. Parse and Break Down Each Query: Identify selected columns, functions, and expressions. Note the tables involved and the join conditions. Understand the filtering conditions applied. Identify grouping and aggregate conditions, if any. Determine if result ordering affects equivalence.
3. Compare Query Components: Check if both queries use the same tables and join conditions. Compare filtering conditions in the WHERE clauses. Assess whether the same columns and expressions are selected. Identify if different functions or syntaxes achieve the same result. Look for logical equivalence in expressions and calculations.
4. Consider Edge Cases and Data Variations: Conceptualize sample datasets that include edge cases (e.g., NULL values, zero values, special characters). Analyze how each query handles these edge cases. Ensure that data type differences do not affect the outcome. Verify that constraints (e.g., NOT NULL, UNIQUE) are accounted for.
5. Evaluate Aggregations and Calculations: Confirm that aggregate functions (e.g., SUM, COUNT) are applied identically. Ensure calculations (e.g., subtraction, addition) produce the same results.
6. Check for Logical Equivalence in Conditional Expressions: Compare conditional expressions like IIF, CASE WHEN, and IF. Determine if conditions and returned values are logically the same.
7. Assess Ordering of Results: If ORDER BY clause is present, confirm that both queries order results identically. Recognize that differing order may affect equivalence if result order is significant.
8. Generate a New Logical Equivalence Rule (If Applicable): Create an "Equivalent Queries: <query1>
<query2>
Schema Conditions:<conditions>" statement that defines the equivalence. Use GENERALIZED COLUMN and TABLE NAMES. Specify any necessary conditions based on the database schema. Present the rule clearly, indicating both the equivalence and the conditions under which it holds.



Example Equivalence Rules:

# Guidelines:
- Make SURE complete to every step PERFECTLY without ANY Mistakes
- Follow the Rules I Gave you and Remember to AVOID generating repeated equivalence rules in the examples I gave you.
- Be sure to format your response like the example equivalence rules I gave you.
- Put <New Rule></New Rule> around the new equivalence rule that you think of. Do not use other formatting around the equivalent queries.
- Use GENERALIZED COLUMN AND TABLE NAMES in any EQUIVALENCE RULE YOU WRITE. DO NOT USE THE SAME NAMES IN THE PROVIDED QUERY PAIRS!!!!
- If the two queries are not logically equivalent, say <New Rule> Not equivalent </New Rule>.
- If the new equivalence rule is already repeated in the examples listed, say <New Rule> Rule exists </New Rule>.
- The new rule should be be MINIMAL to CLEARLY demonstrate the highlighted semantic difference. Use ellipses to shorten SQL queries where necessary to achieve this.

Take a Deep Breath and Carefully Follow the Rules, Guides and Examples I gave you. I will tip you $2000 if you do EVERYTHING Perfectly.



Pair of SQL Queries:
<Gold SQL Query>
SELECT T2.language FROM sets AS T1 INNER JOIN set_translations AS T2 ON T1.code = T2.setCode WHERE T1.mcmName = 'Archenemy' AND T2.setCode = 'ARC';
</Gold SQL Query>

<Machine-generated SQL Query>
SELECT DISTINCT set_translations.language FROM sets INNER JOIN set_translations ON sets.code = set_translations.setcode WHERE sets.mcmname = 'Archenemy' AND sets.code = 'ARC';
</Machine-generated SQL Query>

INFO:root:model: gpt-4o
INFO:root:prompt: You are an expert SQL engineer with 20+ years of experience. You will be given some SQL equivalence rules conditional on some database schemas. You will then be given a pair of SQL queries, consisting of a gold query and a machine-generated query, and a database schema that defines the context of the queries. 

Your task is to compare the two provided SQL queries on logical equivalence and generate one more equivalence rule in the same format as the provided example equivalence rules.

Please make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please also keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.



Evaluation Criteria:

Logical equivalence - the alignment between the gold SQL query and the machine-generated SQL query. A machine-generated SQL query is logically equivalent to the gold query if these two queries would RETURN THE SAME RESULTS AND IN THE SAME ORDER for ALL POSSIBLE DATABASE INSTANCES that satisfy the provided database schema for these queries. Annotators were asked to penalize machine-generated queries that overlooked edge cases that the gold queries would have caught otherwise.



Evaluation steps:

1. Understand the Database Schema: Identify all tables used in both queries. List all columns referenced, along with their data types and constraints. Determine primary and foreign key relationships. Note any indexes or unique constraints that may affect query execution.
2. Parse and Break Down Each Query: Identify selected columns, functions, and expressions. Note the tables involved and the join conditions. Understand the filtering conditions applied. Identify grouping and aggregate conditions, if any. Determine if result ordering affects equivalence.
3. Compare Query Components: Check if both queries use the same tables and join conditions. Compare filtering conditions in the WHERE clauses. Assess whether the same columns and expressions are selected. Identify if different functions or syntaxes achieve the same result. Look for logical equivalence in expressions and calculations.
4. Consider Edge Cases and Data Variations: Conceptualize sample datasets that include edge cases (e.g., NULL values, zero values, special characters). Analyze how each query handles these edge cases. Ensure that data type differences do not affect the outcome. Verify that constraints (e.g., NOT NULL, UNIQUE) are accounted for.
5. Evaluate Aggregations and Calculations: Confirm that aggregate functions (e.g., SUM, COUNT) are applied identically. Ensure calculations (e.g., subtraction, addition) produce the same results.
6. Check for Logical Equivalence in Conditional Expressions: Compare conditional expressions like IIF, CASE WHEN, and IF. Determine if conditions and returned values are logically the same.
7. Assess Ordering of Results: If ORDER BY clause is present, confirm that both queries order results identically. Recognize that differing order may affect equivalence if result order is significant.
8. Generate a New Logical Equivalence Rule (If Applicable): Create an "Equivalent Queries: <query1>
<query2>
Schema Conditions:<conditions>" statement that defines the equivalence. Use GENERALIZED COLUMN and TABLE NAMES. Specify any necessary conditions based on the database schema. Present the rule clearly, indicating both the equivalence and the conditions under which it holds.



Example Equivalence Rules:

<Rule1>
Equivalent Queries:
SELECT COUNT(primary_key_col) FROM table WHERE condition1 AND column = (SELECT MAX(column) FROM table);
SELECT COUNT(foreign_key_col) FROM table WHERE condition1 AND column = (SELECT MAX(column) FROM table);
Schema Conditions:
foreign_key_col is a non-nullable foreign key.
</Rule1>

<Rule2>
Equivalent Queries:
SELECT column_name FROM table_name WHERE SUBSTR(date_column, 1, 7) = 'YYYY-MM';
SELECT column_name FROM table_name WHERE date_column LIKE 'YYYY-MM%';
Schema Conditions:
None.
</Rule2>

<Rule3>
Equivalent Queries:
SELECT ... FROM table WHERE condition1 AND condition2;
SELECT ... FROM table WHERE condition2 AND condition1;
Schema Conditions:
None.
</Rule3>

<Rule4>
Equivalent Queries:
SELECT T2.col2 FROM table1 AS T1 INNER JOIN table2 AS T2 ON T1.col1 = T2.col1 WHERE T1.col3 = 'value1' AND T1.col4 = 'value2';
SELECT table2.col2 FROM table2 INNER JOIN table1 ON table2.col1 = table1.col1 WHERE table1.col3 = 'value1' AND table1.col4 = 'value2';
Schema Conditions:
table1.col1 is a foreign key referencing table2.col1, and table2.col1 is a primary key.
</Rule4>

<Rule5>
Equivalent Queries:
SELECT COUNT(table1.col1) FROM table1 INNER JOIN table2 ON table1.col1 = table2.col2 INNER JOIN table3 ON table2.col3 = table3.col4 WHERE table1.condition1 = 'value' AND table3.condition2 = 'value';
SELECT COUNT(table3.col4) FROM table3 INNER JOIN table2 ON table3.col4 = table2.col3 INNER JOIN table1 ON table2.col2 = table1.col1 WHERE table1.condition1 = 'value' AND table3.condition2 = 'value';
Schema Conditions:
table1.col1 is a primary key, table3.col4 is a primary key, and table2.col2 and table2.col3 are foreign keys referencing table1.col1 and table3.col4 respectively.
</Rule5>

<Rule6>
Equivalent Queries:
SELECT SUM(IIF(condition1, expr1, 0)) - SUM(IIF(condition2, expr2, 0)) FROM table;
SELECT SUM(CASE WHEN condition1 THEN expr1 ELSE 0 END) - SUM(CASE WHEN condition2 THEN expr2 ELSE 0 END) FROM table;
Schema Conditions:
None.
</Rule6>

<Rule7>
Equivalent Queries:
SELECT CAST(COUNT(CASE WHEN t1.col1 = 'value' THEN t2.col2 END) AS REAL) * 100 / COUNT(t2.col2) FROM table1 AS t1 INNER JOIN table2 AS t2 ON t2.col2 = t1.col2 WHERE t2.col3 = 'value';
SELECT CAST(SUM(CASE WHEN table1.col1 = 'value' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS REAL) * 100 / COUNT(table2.col2) FROM table2 INNER JOIN table1 ON table2.col2 = table1.col2 WHERE table2.col3 = 'value';
Schema Conditions:
table2.col2 is a foreign key referencing table1.col2, and table1.col2 is a primary key.
</Rule7>

<Rule8>
Equivalent Queries:
SELECT CAST(SUM(IIF(condition, 1, 0)) AS FLOAT) / SUM(IIF(condition, 1, 0)) FROM table;
SELECT CAST(SUM(CASE WHEN condition THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS REAL) / SUM(CASE WHEN condition THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) FROM table;
Schema Conditions:
None.
</Rule8>

<Rule9>
Equivalent Queries:
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM table1 INNER JOIN table2 ON table1.col1 = table2.col2 WHERE condition;
SELECT COUNT(table1.col1) FROM table2 INNER JOIN table1 ON table2.col2 = table1.col1 WHERE condition;

Schema Conditions:
table1.col1 is a foreign key referencing table2.col1, and table2.col1 is a primary key.
</Rule11>

# Guidelines:
- Make SURE complete to every step PERFECTLY without ANY Mistakes
- Follow the Rules I Gave you and Remember to AVOID generating repeated equivalence rules in the examples I gave you.
- Be sure to format your response like the example equivalence rules I gave you.
- Put <New Rule></New Rule> around the new equivalence rule that you think of. Do not use other formatting around the equivalent queries.
- Use GENERALIZED COLUMN AND TABLE NAMES in any EQUIVALENCE RULE YOU WRITE. DO NOT USE THE SAME NAMES IN THE PROVIDED QUERY PAIRS!!!!
- If the two queries are not logically equivalent, say <New Rule> Not equivalent </New Rule>.
- If the new equivalence rule is already repeated in the examples listed, say <New Rule> Rule exists </New Rule>.
- The new rule should be be MINIMAL to CLEARLY demonstrate the highlighted semantic difference. Use ellipses to shorten SQL queries where necessary to achieve this.

Take a Deep Breath and Carefully Follow the Rules, Guides and Examples I gave you. I will tip you $2000 if you do EVERYTHING Perfectly.



Pair of SQL Queries:
<Gold SQL Query>
SELECT COUNT(T1.id) FROM cards AS T1 INNER JOIN set_translations AS T2 ON T2.setCode = T1.setCode WHERE T2.translation = 'Hauptset Zehnte Edition' AND T1.artist = 'Adam Rex';

The difference in counting `T1.id` versus `*` does not affect the result due to `id` being a non-nullable primary key.\n\n### Step 8: Generate a New Logical Equivalence Rule\n\n<New Rule>\nEquivalent Queries:\nSELECT COUNT(primary_key_col) FROM table1 INNER JOIN table2 ON table1.fk_col = table2.pk_col WHERE table2.translation = 'value' AND table1.artist = 'value';\nSELECT COUNT(*) FROM table1 INNER JOIN table2 ON table1.fk_col = table2.pk_col WHERE table2.translation = 'value' AND table1.artist = 'value';\nSchema Conditions:\nprimary_key_col is a non-nullable primary key.\n", role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None, refusal=None))], created=1730780042, model='gpt-4o-2024-08-06', object='chat.completion', system_fingerprint='fp_45cf54deae', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=660, prompt_tokens=3680, total_tokens=4340, prompt_tokens_details={'cached_tokens': 0}, completion_tokens_details={'reasoning_tokens': 0, 'accepted_prediction_tokens': 0, 'rejected_prediction_tokens': 0}))

INFO:root:model: gpt-4o
INFO:root:prompt: You are an expert SQL engineer with 20+ years of experience. You will be given some SQL equivalence rules conditional on some database schemas. You will then be given a pair of SQL queries, consisting of a gold query and a machine-generated query, and a database schema that defines the context of the queries. 

Your task is to compare the two provided SQL queries on logical equivalence and generate one more equivalence rule in the same format as the provided example equivalence rules.

Please make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please also keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.



Evaluation Criteria:

Logical equivalence - the alignment between the gold SQL query and the machine-generated SQL query. A machine-generated SQL query is logically equivalent to the gold query if these two queries would RETURN THE SAME RESULTS AND IN THE SAME ORDER for ALL POSSIBLE DATABASE INSTANCES that satisfy the provided database schema for these queries. Annotators were asked to penalize machine-generated queries that overlooked edge cases that the gold queries would have caught otherwise.



Evaluation steps:

1. Understand the Database Schema: Identify all tables used in both queries. List all columns referenced, along with their data types and constraints. Determine primary and foreign key relationships. Note any indexes or unique constraints that may affect query execution.
2. Parse and Break Down Each Query: Identify selected columns, functions, and expressions. Note the tables involved and the join conditions. Understand the filtering conditions applied. Identify grouping and aggregate conditions, if any. Determine if result ordering affects equivalence.
3. Compare Query Components: Check if both queries use the same tables and join conditions. Compare filtering conditions in the WHERE clauses. Assess whether the same columns and expressions are selected. Identify if different functions or syntaxes achieve the same result. Look for logical equivalence in expressions and calculations.
4. Consider Edge Cases and Data Variations: Conceptualize sample datasets that include edge cases (e.g., NULL values, zero values, special characters). Analyze how each query handles these edge cases. Ensure that data type differences do not affect the outcome. Verify that constraints (e.g., NOT NULL, UNIQUE) are accounted for.
5. Evaluate Aggregations and Calculations: Confirm that aggregate functions (e.g., SUM, COUNT) are applied identically. Ensure calculations (e.g., subtraction, addition) produce the same results.
6. Check for Logical Equivalence in Conditional Expressions: Compare conditional expressions like IIF, CASE WHEN, and IF. Determine if conditions and returned values are logically the same.
7. Assess Ordering of Results: If ORDER BY clause is present, confirm that both queries order results identically. Recognize that differing order may affect equivalence if result order is significant.
8. Generate a New Logical Equivalence Rule (If Applicable): Create an "Equivalent Queries: <query1>
<query2>
Schema Conditions:<conditions>" statement that defines the equivalence. Use GENERALIZED COLUMN and TABLE NAMES. Specify any necessary conditions based on the database schema. Present the rule clearly, indicating both the equivalence and the conditions under which it holds.

# Guidelines:
- Make SURE complete to every step PERFECTLY without ANY Mistakes
- Follow the Rules I Gave you and Remember to AVOID generating repeated equivalence rules in the examples I gave you.
- Be sure to format your response like the example equivalence rules I gave you.
- Put <New Rule></New Rule> around the new equivalence rule that you think of. Do not use other formatting around the equivalent queries.
- Use GENERALIZED COLUMN AND TABLE NAMES in any EQUIVALENCE RULE YOU WRITE. DO NOT USE THE SAME NAMES IN THE PROVIDED QUERY PAIRS!!!!
- If the two queries are not logically equivalent, say <New Rule> Not equivalent </New Rule>.
- If the new equivalence rule is already repeated in the examples listed, say <New Rule> Rule exists </New Rule>.
- The new rule should be be MINIMAL to CLEARLY demonstrate the highlighted semantic difference. Use ellipses to shorten SQL queries where necessary to achieve this.

Take a Deep Breath and Carefully Follow the Rules, Guides and Examples I gave you. I will tip you $2000 if you do EVERYTHING Perfectly.

INFO:root:model: gpt-4o
INFO:root:prompt: You are an expert SQL engineer with 20+ years of experience. You will be given some SQL equivalence rules conditional on some database schemas. You will then be given a pair of SQL queries, consisting of a gold query and a machine-generated query, and a database schema that defines the context of the queries. 

Your task is to compare the two provided SQL queries on logical equivalence and generate one more equivalence rule in the same format as the provided example equivalence rules.

Please make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please also keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.



Evaluation Criteria:

Logical equivalence - the alignment between the gold SQL query and the machine-generated SQL query. A machine-generated SQL query is logically equivalent to the gold query if these two queries would RETURN THE SAME RESULTS AND IN THE SAME ORDER for ALL POSSIBLE DATABASE INSTANCES that satisfy the provided database schema for these queries. Annotators were asked to penalize machine-generated queries that overlooked edge cases that the gold queries would have caught otherwise.



Evaluation steps:

1. Understand the Database Schema: Identify all tables used in both queries. List all columns referenced, along with their data types and constraints. Determine primary and foreign key relationships. Note any indexes or unique constraints that may affect query execution.
2. Parse and Break Down Each Query: Identify selected columns, functions, and expressions. Note the tables involved and the join conditions. Understand the filtering conditions applied. Identify grouping and aggregate conditions, if any. Determine if result ordering affects equivalence.
3. Compare Query Components: Check if both queries use the same tables and join conditions. Compare filtering conditions in the WHERE clauses. Assess whether the same columns and expressions are selected. Identify if different functions or syntaxes achieve the same result. Look for logical equivalence in expressions and calculations.
4. Consider Edge Cases and Data Variations: Conceptualize sample datasets that include edge cases (e.g., NULL values, zero values, special characters). Analyze how each query handles these edge cases. Ensure that data type differences do not affect the outcome. Verify that constraints (e.g., NOT NULL, UNIQUE) are accounted for.
5. Evaluate Aggregations and Calculations: Confirm that aggregate functions (e.g., SUM, COUNT) are applied identically. Ensure calculations (e.g., subtraction, addition) produce the same results.
6. Check for Logical Equivalence in Conditional Expressions: Compare conditional expressions like IIF, CASE WHEN, and IF. Determine if conditions and returned values are logically the same.
7. Assess Ordering of Results: If ORDER BY clause is present, confirm that both queries order results identically. Recognize that differing order may affect equivalence if result order is significant.
8. Generate a New Logical Equivalence Rule (If Applicable): Create an "Equivalent Queries: <query1>
<query2>
Schema Conditions:<conditions>" statement that defines the equivalence. Use GENERALIZED COLUMN and TABLE NAMES. Specify any necessary conditions based on the database schema. Present the rule clearly, indicating both the equivalence and the conditions under which it holds.



Example Equivalence Rules:

# Guidelines:
- Make SURE complete to every step PERFECTLY without ANY Mistakes
- Follow the Rules I Gave you and Remember to AVOID generating repeated equivalence rules in the examples I gave you.
- Be sure to format your response like the example equivalence rules I gave you.
- Put <New Rule></New Rule> around the new equivalence rule that you think of. Do not use other formatting around the equivalent queries.
- Use GENERALIZED COLUMN AND TABLE NAMES in any EQUIVALENCE RULE YOU WRITE. DO NOT USE THE SAME NAMES IN THE PROVIDED QUERY PAIRS!!!!
- If the two queries are not logically equivalent, say <New Rule> Not equivalent </New Rule>.
- If the new equivalence rule is already repeated in the examples listed, say <New Rule> Rule exists </New Rule>.
- The new rule should be be MINIMAL to CLEARLY demonstrate the highlighted semantic difference. Use ellipses to shorten SQL queries where necessary to achieve this.

Take a Deep Breath and Carefully Follow the Rules, Guides and Examples I gave you. I will tip you $2000 if you do EVERYTHING Perfectly.

INFO:root:model: gpt-4o
INFO:root:prompt: You are an expert SQL engineer with 20+ years of experience. You will be given some SQL equivalence rules conditional on some database schemas. You will then be given a pair of SQL queries, consisting of a gold query and a machine-generated query, and a database schema that defines the context of the queries. 

Your task is to compare the two provided SQL queries on logical equivalence and generate one more equivalence rule in the same format as the provided example equivalence rules.

Please make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please also keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.



Evaluation Criteria:

Logical equivalence - the alignment between the gold SQL query and the machine-generated SQL query. A machine-generated SQL query is logically equivalent to the gold query if these two queries would RETURN THE SAME RESULTS AND IN THE SAME ORDER for ALL POSSIBLE DATABASE INSTANCES that satisfy the provided database schema for these queries. Annotators were asked to penalize machine-generated queries that overlooked edge cases that the gold queries would have caught otherwise.



Evaluation steps:

1. Understand the Database Schema: Identify all tables used in both queries. List all columns referenced, along with their data types and constraints. Determine primary and foreign key relationships. Note any indexes or unique constraints that may affect query execution.
2. Parse and Break Down Each Query: Identify selected columns, functions, and expressions. Note the tables involved and the join conditions. Understand the filtering conditions applied. Identify grouping and aggregate conditions, if any. Determine if result ordering affects equivalence.
3. Compare Query Components: Check if both queries use the same tables and join conditions. Compare filtering conditions in the WHERE clauses. Assess whether the same columns and expressions are selected. Identify if different functions or syntaxes achieve the same result. Look for logical equivalence in expressions and calculations.
4. Consider Edge Cases and Data Variations: Conceptualize sample datasets that include edge cases (e.g., NULL values, zero values, special characters). Analyze how each query handles these edge cases. Ensure that data type differences do not affect the outcome. Verify that constraints (e.g., NOT NULL, UNIQUE) are accounted for.
5. Evaluate Aggregations and Calculations: Confirm that aggregate functions (e.g., SUM, COUNT) are applied identically. Ensure calculations (e.g., subtraction, addition) produce the same results.
6. Check for Logical Equivalence in Conditional Expressions: Compare conditional expressions like IIF, CASE WHEN, and IF. Determine if conditions and returned values are logically the same.
7. Assess Ordering of Results: If ORDER BY clause is present, confirm that both queries order results identically. Recognize that differing order may affect equivalence if result order is significant.
8. Generate a New Logical Equivalence Rule (If Applicable): Create an "Equivalent Queries: <query1>
<query2>
Schema Conditions:<conditions>" statement that defines the equivalence. Use GENERALIZED COLUMN and TABLE NAMES. Specify any necessary conditions based on the database schema. Present the rule clearly, indicating both the equivalence and the conditions under which it holds.

# Guidelines:
- Make SURE complete to every step PERFECTLY without ANY Mistakes
- Follow the Rules I Gave you and Remember to AVOID generating repeated equivalence rules in the examples I gave you.
- Be sure to format your response like the example equivalence rules I gave you.
- Put <New Rule></New Rule> around the new equivalence rule that you think of. Do not use other formatting around the equivalent queries.
- Use GENERALIZED COLUMN AND TABLE NAMES in any EQUIVALENCE RULE YOU WRITE. DO NOT USE THE SAME NAMES IN THE PROVIDED QUERY PAIRS!!!!
- If the two queries are not logically equivalent, say <New Rule> Not equivalent </New Rule>.
- If the new equivalence rule is already repeated in the examples listed, say <New Rule> Rule exists </New Rule>.
- The new rule should be be MINIMAL to CLEARLY demonstrate the highlighted semantic difference. Use ellipses to shorten SQL queries where necessary to achieve this.

Take a Deep Breath and Carefully Follow the Rules, Guides and Examples I gave you. I will tip you $2000 if you do EVERYTHING Perfectly.

INFO:root:prompt: You are an expert SQL engineer with 20+ years of experience. You will be given some SQL equivalence rules conditional on some database schemas. You will then be given a pair of SQL queries, consisting of a gold query and a machine-generated query, and a database schema that defines the context of the queries. 

Your task is to compare the two provided SQL queries on logical equivalence and generate one more equivalence rule in the same format as the provided example equivalence rules.

Please make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please also keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.



Evaluation Criteria:

Logical equivalence - the alignment between the gold SQL query and the machine-generated SQL query. A machine-generated SQL query is logically equivalent to the gold query if these two queries would RETURN THE SAME RESULTS AND IN THE SAME ORDER for ALL POSSIBLE DATABASE INSTANCES that satisfy the provided database schema for these queries. Annotators were asked to penalize machine-generated queries that overlooked edge cases that the gold queries would have caught otherwise.



Evaluation steps:

1. Understand the Database Schema: Identify all tables used in both queries. List all columns referenced, along with their data types and constraints. Determine primary and foreign key relationships. Note any indexes or unique constraints that may affect query execution.
2. Parse and Break Down Each Query: Identify selected columns, functions, and expressions. Note the tables involved and the join conditions. Understand the filtering conditions applied. Identify grouping and aggregate conditions, if any. Determine if result ordering affects equivalence.
3. Compare Query Components: Check if both queries use the same tables and join conditions. Compare filtering conditions in the WHERE clauses. Assess whether the same columns and expressions are selected. Identify if different functions or syntaxes achieve the same result. Look for logical equivalence in expressions and calculations.
4. Consider Edge Cases and Data Variations: Conceptualize sample datasets that include edge cases (e.g., NULL values, zero values, special characters). Analyze how each query handles these edge cases. Ensure that data type differences do not affect the outcome. Verify that constraints (e.g., NOT NULL, UNIQUE) are accounted for.
5. Evaluate Aggregations and Calculations: Confirm that aggregate functions (e.g., SUM, COUNT) are applied identically. Ensure calculations (e.g., subtraction, addition) produce the same results.
6. Check for Logical Equivalence in Conditional Expressions: Compare conditional expressions like IIF, CASE WHEN, and IF. Determine if conditions and returned values are logically the same.
7. Assess Ordering of Results: If ORDER BY clause is present, confirm that both queries order results identically. Recognize that differing order may affect equivalence if result order is significant.
8. Generate a New Logical Equivalence Rule (If Applicable): Create an "Equivalent Queries: <query1>
<query2>
Schema Conditions:<conditions>" statement that defines the equivalence. Use GENERALIZED COLUMN and TABLE NAMES. Specify any necessary conditions based on the database schema. Present the rule clearly, indicating both the equivalence and the conditions under which it holds.

# Guidelines:
- Make SURE complete to every step PERFECTLY without ANY Mistakes
- Follow the Rules I Gave you and Remember to AVOID generating repeated equivalence rules in the examples I gave you.
- Be sure to format your response like the example equivalence rules I gave you.
- Put <New Rule></New Rule> around the new equivalence rule that you think of. Do not use other formatting around the equivalent queries.
- Use GENERALIZED COLUMN AND TABLE NAMES in any EQUIVALENCE RULE YOU WRITE. DO NOT USE THE SAME NAMES IN THE PROVIDED QUERY PAIRS!!!!
- If the two queries are not logically equivalent, say <New Rule> Not equivalent </New Rule>.
- If the new equivalence rule is already repeated in the examples listed, say <New Rule> Rule exists </New Rule>.
- The new rule should be be MINIMAL to CLEARLY demonstrate the highlighted semantic difference. Use ellipses to shorten SQL queries where necessary to achieve this.

Take a Deep Breath and Carefully Follow the Rules, Guides and Examples I gave you. I will tip you $2000 if you do EVERYTHING Perfectly.

Compare Query Components\n\n- **Tables Used**: Both use only the `bond` table.\n- **Grouping**: Both group by `bond_type`.\n- **Ordering**: Both order by the count of the grouped `bond_type`.\n- **Selection**: Both ultimately select the `bond_type` with the highest count.\n- **Limiting**: Both limit the result to one row.\n\n### 4. Consider Edge Cases and Data Variations\n\n- **NULL values**: `bond_type` is TEXT and can be NULL. Both queries would handle this in the same way by counting non-null values.\n- **Count Function**: `COUNT(bond_id)` and `count(bond_type)` are equivalent in this context as both count non-null entries per `bond_type`.\n\n### 5. Evaluate Aggregations and Calculations\n\nBoth queries aggregate and calculate the count of `bond_type` in the same manner.\n\n### 6. Check for Logical Equivalence in Conditional Expressions\n\nThere are no conditional expressions that affect logical equivalence differently between the two queries.\n\n### 7. Assess Ordering of Results\n\nBoth queries order by the count of `bond_type` in descending order and limit to the top result.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBoth queries are logically equivalent as they return the same result for all possible database instances given the schema.\n\n### 8. Generate a New Logical Equivalence Rule\n\nSince the rule is not already listed in the examples, we will generate a new rule:\n\n<New Rule>\nEquivalent Queries:\nSELECT T.col1 FROM (SELECT col1, COUNT(col2) FROM table GROUP BY col1 ORDER BY COUNT(col2) DESC LIMIT 1) AS T;\nSELECT col1 FROM table GROUP BY col1 ORDER BY COUNT(col1) DESC LIMIT 1;\nSchema Conditions:\nNone.\n", role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None, refusal=None))], created=1730780139, model='gpt-4o-2024-08-06', object='chat.completion', system_fingerprint='fp_45cf54deae', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=635, prompt_tokens=2936, total_tokens=3571, prompt_tokens_details={'cached_tokens': 0}, completion_tokens_details={'reasoning_tokens': 0, 'accepted_prediction_tokens': 0, 'rejected_prediction_tokens': 0}))

INFO:root:prompt: You are an expert SQL engineer with 20+ years of experience. You will be given some SQL equivalence rules conditional on some database schemas. You will then be given a pair of SQL queries, consisting of a gold query and a machine-generated query, and a database schema that defines the context of the queries. 

Your task is to compare the two provided SQL queries on logical equivalence and generate one more equivalence rule in the same format as the provided example equivalence rules.

Please make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please also keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.



Evaluation Criteria:

Logical equivalence - the alignment between the gold SQL query and the machine-generated SQL query. A machine-generated SQL query is logically equivalent to the gold query if these two queries would RETURN THE SAME RESULTS AND IN THE SAME ORDER for ALL POSSIBLE DATABASE INSTANCES that satisfy the provided database schema for these queries. Annotators were asked to penalize machine-generated queries that overlooked edge cases that the gold queries would have caught otherwise.



Evaluation steps:

1. Understand the Database Schema: Identify all tables used in both queries. List all columns referenced, along with their data types and constraints. Determine primary and foreign key relationships. Note any indexes or unique constraints that may affect query execution.
2. Parse and Break Down Each Query: Identify selected columns, functions, and expressions. Note the tables involved and the join conditions. Understand the filtering conditions applied. Identify grouping and aggregate conditions, if any. Determine if result ordering affects equivalence.
3. Compare Query Components: Check if both queries use the same tables and join conditions. Compare filtering conditions in the WHERE clauses. Assess whether the same columns and expressions are selected. Identify if different functions or syntaxes achieve the same result. Look for logical equivalence in expressions and calculations.
4. Consider Edge Cases and Data Variations: Conceptualize sample datasets that include edge cases (e.g., NULL values, zero values, special characters). Analyze how each query handles these edge cases. Ensure that data type differences do not affect the outcome. Verify that constraints (e.g., NOT NULL, UNIQUE) are accounted for.
5. Evaluate Aggregations and Calculations: Confirm that aggregate functions (e.g., SUM, COUNT) are applied identically. Ensure calculations (e.g., subtraction, addition) produce the same results.
6. Check for Logical Equivalence in Conditional Expressions: Compare conditional expressions like IIF, CASE WHEN, and IF. Determine if conditions and returned values are logically the same.
7. Assess Ordering of Results: If ORDER BY clause is present, confirm that both queries order results identically. Recognize that differing order may affect equivalence if result order is significant.
8. Generate a New Logical Equivalence Rule (If Applicable): Create an "Equivalent Queries: <query1>
<query2>
Schema Conditions:<conditions>" statement that defines the equivalence. Use GENERALIZED COLUMN and TABLE NAMES. Specify any necessary conditions based on the database schema. Present the rule clearly, indicating both the equivalence and the conditions under which it holds.

# Guidelines:
- Make SURE complete to every step PERFECTLY without ANY Mistakes
- Follow the Rules I Gave you and Remember to AVOID generating repeated equivalence rules in the examples I gave you.
- Be sure to format your response like the example equivalence rules I gave you.
- Put <New Rule></New Rule> around the new equivalence rule that you think of. Do not use other formatting around the equivalent queries.
- Use GENERALIZED COLUMN AND TABLE NAMES in any EQUIVALENCE RULE YOU WRITE. DO NOT USE THE SAME NAMES IN THE PROVIDED QUERY PAIRS!!!!
- If the two queries are not logically equivalent, say <New Rule> Not equivalent </New Rule>.
- If the new equivalence rule is already repeated in the examples listed, say <New Rule> Rule exists </New Rule>.
- The new rule should be be MINIMAL to CLEARLY demonstrate the highlighted semantic difference. Use ellipses to shorten SQL queries where necessary to achieve this.

Take a Deep Breath and Carefully Follow the Rules, Guides and Examples I gave you. I will tip you $2000 if you do EVERYTHING Perfectly.

INFO:root:prompt: You are an expert SQL engineer with 20+ years of experience. You will be given some SQL equivalence rules conditional on some database schemas. You will then be given a pair of SQL queries, consisting of a gold query and a machine-generated query, and a database schema that defines the context of the queries. 

Your task is to compare the two provided SQL queries on logical equivalence and generate one more equivalence rule in the same format as the provided example equivalence rules.

Please make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please also keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.



Evaluation Criteria:

Logical equivalence - the alignment between the gold SQL query and the machine-generated SQL query. A machine-generated SQL query is logically equivalent to the gold query if these two queries would RETURN THE SAME RESULTS AND IN THE SAME ORDER for ALL POSSIBLE DATABASE INSTANCES that satisfy the provided database schema for these queries. Annotators were asked to penalize machine-generated queries that overlooked edge cases that the gold queries would have caught otherwise.



Evaluation steps:

1. Understand the Database Schema: Identify all tables used in both queries. List all columns referenced, along with their data types and constraints. Determine primary and foreign key relationships. Note any indexes or unique constraints that may affect query execution.
2. Parse and Break Down Each Query: Identify selected columns, functions, and expressions. Note the tables involved and the join conditions. Understand the filtering conditions applied. Identify grouping and aggregate conditions, if any. Determine if result ordering affects equivalence.
3. Compare Query Components: Check if both queries use the same tables and join conditions. Compare filtering conditions in the WHERE clauses. Assess whether the same columns and expressions are selected. Identify if different functions or syntaxes achieve the same result. Look for logical equivalence in expressions and calculations.
4. Consider Edge Cases and Data Variations: Conceptualize sample datasets that include edge cases (e.g., NULL values, zero values, special characters). Analyze how each query handles these edge cases. Ensure that data type differences do not affect the outcome. Verify that constraints (e.g., NOT NULL, UNIQUE) are accounted for.
5. Evaluate Aggregations and Calculations: Confirm that aggregate functions (e.g., SUM, COUNT) are applied identically. Ensure calculations (e.g., subtraction, addition) produce the same results.
6. Check for Logical Equivalence in Conditional Expressions: Compare conditional expressions like IIF, CASE WHEN, and IF. Determine if conditions and returned values are logically the same.
7. Assess Ordering of Results: If ORDER BY clause is present, confirm that both queries order results identically. Recognize that differing order may affect equivalence if result order is significant.
8. Generate a New Logical Equivalence Rule (If Applicable): Create an "Equivalent Queries: <query1>
<query2>
Schema Conditions:<conditions>" statement that defines the equivalence. Use GENERALIZED COLUMN and TABLE NAMES. Specify any necessary conditions based on the database schema. Present the rule clearly, indicating both the equivalence and the conditions under which it holds.

INFO:root:prompt: You are an expert SQL engineer with 20+ years of experience. You will be given some SQL equivalence rules conditional on some database schemas. You will then be given a pair of SQL queries, consisting of a gold query and a machine-generated query, and a database schema that defines the context of the queries. 

Your task is to compare the two provided SQL queries on logical equivalence and generate one more equivalence rule in the same format as the provided example equivalence rules.

Please make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please also keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.



Evaluation Criteria:

Logical equivalence - the alignment between the gold SQL query and the machine-generated SQL query. A machine-generated SQL query is logically equivalent to the gold query if these two queries would RETURN THE SAME RESULTS AND IN THE SAME ORDER for ALL POSSIBLE DATABASE INSTANCES that satisfy the provided database schema for these queries. Annotators were asked to penalize machine-generated queries that overlooked edge cases that the gold queries would have caught otherwise.



Evaluation steps:

1. Understand the Database Schema: Identify all tables used in both queries. List all columns referenced, along with their data types and constraints. Determine primary and foreign key relationships. Note any indexes or unique constraints that may affect query execution.
2. Parse and Break Down Each Query: Identify selected columns, functions, and expressions. Note the tables involved and the join conditions. Understand the filtering conditions applied. Identify grouping and aggregate conditions, if any. Determine if result ordering affects equivalence.
3. Compare Query Components: Check if both queries use the same tables and join conditions. Compare filtering conditions in the WHERE clauses. Assess whether the same columns and expressions are selected. Identify if different functions or syntaxes achieve the same result. Look for logical equivalence in expressions and calculations.
4. Consider Edge Cases and Data Variations: Conceptualize sample datasets that include edge cases (e.g., NULL values, zero values, special characters). Analyze how each query handles these edge cases. Ensure that data type differences do not affect the outcome. Verify that constraints (e.g., NOT NULL, UNIQUE) are accounted for.
5. Evaluate Aggregations and Calculations: Confirm that aggregate functions (e.g., SUM, COUNT) are applied identically. Ensure calculations (e.g., subtraction, addition) produce the same results.
6. Check for Logical Equivalence in Conditional Expressions: Compare conditional expressions like IIF, CASE WHEN, and IF. Determine if conditions and returned values are logically the same.
7. Assess Ordering of Results: If ORDER BY clause is present, confirm that both queries order results identically. Recognize that differing order may affect equivalence if result order is significant.
8. Generate a New Logical Equivalence Rule (If Applicable): Create an "Equivalent Queries: <query1>
<query2>
Schema Conditions:<conditions>" statement that defines the equivalence. Use GENERALIZED COLUMN and TABLE NAMES. Specify any necessary conditions based on the database schema. Present the rule clearly, indicating both the equivalence and the conditions under which it holds.

# Guidelines:
- Make SURE complete to every step PERFECTLY without ANY Mistakes
- Follow the Rules I Gave you and Remember to AVOID generating repeated equivalence rules in the examples I gave you.
- Be sure to format your response like the example equivalence rules I gave you.
- Put <New Rule></New Rule> around the new equivalence rule that you think of. Do not use other formatting around the equivalent queries.
- Use GENERALIZED COLUMN AND TABLE NAMES in any EQUIVALENCE RULE YOU WRITE. DO NOT USE THE SAME NAMES IN THE PROVIDED QUERY PAIRS!!!!
- If the two queries are not logically equivalent, say <New Rule> Not equivalent </New Rule>.
- If the new equivalence rule is already repeated in the examples listed, say <New Rule> Rule exists </New Rule>.
- The new rule should be be MINIMAL to CLEARLY demonstrate the highlighted semantic difference. Use ellipses to shorten SQL queries where necessary to achieve this.

Take a Deep Breath and Carefully Follow the Rules, Guides and Examples I gave you. I will tip you $2000 if you do EVERYTHING Perfectly.

INFO:root:prompt: You are an expert SQL engineer with 20+ years of experience. You will be given some SQL equivalence rules conditional on some database schemas. You will then be given a pair of SQL queries, consisting of a gold query and a machine-generated query, and a database schema that defines the context of the queries. 

Your task is to compare the two provided SQL queries on logical equivalence and generate one more equivalence rule in the same format as the provided example equivalence rules.

Please make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please also keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.



Evaluation Criteria:

Logical equivalence - the alignment between the gold SQL query and the machine-generated SQL query. A machine-generated SQL query is logically equivalent to the gold query if these two queries would RETURN THE SAME RESULTS AND IN THE SAME ORDER for ALL POSSIBLE DATABASE INSTANCES that satisfy the provided database schema for these queries. Annotators were asked to penalize machine-generated queries that overlooked edge cases that the gold queries would have caught otherwise.



Evaluation steps:

1. Understand the Database Schema: Identify all tables used in both queries. List all columns referenced, along with their data types and constraints. Determine primary and foreign key relationships. Note any indexes or unique constraints that may affect query execution.
2. Parse and Break Down Each Query: Identify selected columns, functions, and expressions. Note the tables involved and the join conditions. Understand the filtering conditions applied. Identify grouping and aggregate conditions, if any. Determine if result ordering affects equivalence.
3. Compare Query Components: Check if both queries use the same tables and join conditions. Compare filtering conditions in the WHERE clauses. Assess whether the same columns and expressions are selected. Identify if different functions or syntaxes achieve the same result. Look for logical equivalence in expressions and calculations.
4. Consider Edge Cases and Data Variations: Conceptualize sample datasets that include edge cases (e.g., NULL values, zero values, special characters). Analyze how each query handles these edge cases. Ensure that data type differences do not affect the outcome. Verify that constraints (e.g., NOT NULL, UNIQUE) are accounted for.
5. Evaluate Aggregations and Calculations: Confirm that aggregate functions (e.g., SUM, COUNT) are applied identically. Ensure calculations (e.g., subtraction, addition) produce the same results.
6. Check for Logical Equivalence in Conditional Expressions: Compare conditional expressions like IIF, CASE WHEN, and IF. Determine if conditions and returned values are logically the same.
7. Assess Ordering of Results: If ORDER BY clause is present, confirm that both queries order results identically. Recognize that differing order may affect equivalence if result order is significant.
8. Generate a New Logical Equivalence Rule (If Applicable): Create an "Equivalent Queries: <query1>
<query2>
Schema Conditions:<conditions>" statement that defines the equivalence. Use GENERALIZED COLUMN and TABLE NAMES. Specify any necessary conditions based on the database schema. Present the rule clearly, indicating both the equivalence and the conditions under which it holds.

INFO:root:prompt: You are an expert SQL engineer with 20+ years of experience. You will be given some SQL equivalence rules conditional on some database schemas. You will then be given a pair of SQL queries, consisting of a gold query and a machine-generated query, and a database schema that defines the context of the queries. 

Your task is to compare the two provided SQL queries on logical equivalence and generate one more equivalence rule in the same format as the provided example equivalence rules.

Please make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please also keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.



Evaluation Criteria:

Logical equivalence - the alignment between the gold SQL query and the machine-generated SQL query. A machine-generated SQL query is logically equivalent to the gold query if these two queries would RETURN THE SAME RESULTS AND IN THE SAME ORDER for ALL POSSIBLE DATABASE INSTANCES that satisfy the provided database schema for these queries. Annotators were asked to penalize machine-generated queries that overlooked edge cases that the gold queries would have caught otherwise.



Evaluation steps:

1. Understand the Database Schema: Identify all tables used in both queries. List all columns referenced, along with their data types and constraints. Determine primary and foreign key relationships. Note any indexes or unique constraints that may affect query execution.
2. Parse and Break Down Each Query: Identify selected columns, functions, and expressions. Note the tables involved and the join conditions. Understand the filtering conditions applied. Identify grouping and aggregate conditions, if any. Determine if result ordering affects equivalence.
3. Compare Query Components: Check if both queries use the same tables and join conditions. Compare filtering conditions in the WHERE clauses. Assess whether the same columns and expressions are selected. Identify if different functions or syntaxes achieve the same result. Look for logical equivalence in expressions and calculations.
4. Consider Edge Cases and Data Variations: Conceptualize sample datasets that include edge cases (e.g., NULL values, zero values, special characters). Analyze how each query handles these edge cases. Ensure that data type differences do not affect the outcome. Verify that constraints (e.g., NOT NULL, UNIQUE) are accounted for.
5. Evaluate Aggregations and Calculations: Confirm that aggregate functions (e.g., SUM, COUNT) are applied identically. Ensure calculations (e.g., subtraction, addition) produce the same results.
6. Check for Logical Equivalence in Conditional Expressions: Compare conditional expressions like IIF, CASE WHEN, and IF. Determine if conditions and returned values are logically the same.
7. Assess Ordering of Results: If ORDER BY clause is present, confirm that both queries order results identically. Recognize that differing order may affect equivalence if result order is significant.
8. Generate a New Logical Equivalence Rule (If Applicable): Create an "Equivalent Queries: <query1>
<query2>
Schema Conditions:<conditions>" statement that defines the equivalence. Use GENERALIZED COLUMN and TABLE NAMES. Specify any necessary conditions based on the database schema. Present the rule clearly, indicating both the equivalence and the conditions under which it holds.

# Guidelines:
- Make SURE complete to every step PERFECTLY without ANY Mistakes
- Follow the Rules I Gave you and Remember to AVOID generating repeated equivalence rules in the examples I gave you.
- Be sure to format your response like the example equivalence rules I gave you.
- Put <New Rule></New Rule> around the new equivalence rule that you think of. Do not use other formatting around the equivalent queries.
- Use GENERALIZED COLUMN AND TABLE NAMES in any EQUIVALENCE RULE YOU WRITE. DO NOT USE THE SAME NAMES IN THE PROVIDED QUERY PAIRS!!!!
- If the two queries are not logically equivalent, say <New Rule> Not equivalent </New Rule>.
- If the new equivalence rule is already repeated in the examples listed, say <New Rule> Rule exists </New Rule>.
- The new rule should be be MINIMAL to CLEARLY demonstrate the highlighted semantic difference. Use ellipses to shorten SQL queries where necessary to achieve this.

Take a Deep Breath and Carefully Follow the Rules, Guides and Examples I gave you. I will tip you $2000 if you do EVERYTHING Perfectly.

Let's proceed with the evaluation steps:\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Database Schema\n\n- **Tables and Columns:**\n  - `atom`: `atom_id` (PK), `molecule_id` (FK), `element`\n  - `molecule`: `molecule_id` (PK), `label`\n\n- **Primary and Foreign Key Relationships:**\n  - `atom.molecule_id` is a foreign key referencing `molecule.molecule_id`.\n\n### Step 2: Parse and Break Down Each Query\n\n- **Gold SQL Query:**\n  - **Selected Expression:** `CAST(COUNT(CASE WHEN T1.element = 'cl' THEN T1.element ELSE NULL END) AS REAL) * 100 / COUNT(T1.element)`\n  - **Tables Involved:** `atom` (aliased as `T1`), `molecule` (aliased as `T2`)\n  - **Join Condition:** `T1.molecule_id = T2.molecule_id`\n  - **Filter Condition:** `T2.label = '+'`\n\n- **Machine-generated SQL Query:**\n  - **Selected Expression:** `cast(sum(CASE WHEN atom.element = 'cl' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS REAL) * 100 / count(atom.atom_id)`\n  - **Tables Involved:** `atom`, `molecule`\n  - **Join Condition:** `atom.molecule_id = molecule.molecule_id`\n  - **Filter Condition:** `molecule.label = '+'`\n\n### Step 3: Compare Query Components\n\n- Both queries select from the same tables and have the same join and filter conditions.\n- The Gold Query uses `COUNT(CASE WHEN T1.element = 'cl' THEN T1.element ELSE NULL END)` while the Machine-generated Query uses `SUM(CASE WHEN atom.element = 'cl' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END)`. These expressions are logically equivalent because both count the occurrences where `element = 'cl'`.\n- The denominator in the Gold Query is `COUNT(T1.element)`, whereas in the Machine-generated Query, it is `COUNT(atom.atom_id)`. Since `atom_id` is a primary key and cannot be NULL, `COUNT(atom.atom_id)` will always count all rows, which is equivalent to `COUNT(T1.element)` if `element` is not nullable or always present when `atom_id` is present.\n\n### Step 4: Consider Edge Cases and Data Variations\n\n- Since `atom_id` is a primary key, it is non-nullable. Thus, `COUNT(atom.atom_id)` is equivalent to counting the total rows in the `atom` table after the join and filter conditions are applied.\n- The `element` column is nullable, but the logic of counting non-null values (Gold Query) vs. counting rows (Machine-generated Query) is equivalent here, given how the queries are structured.\n\n### Step 5: Evaluate Aggregations and Calculations\n\n- Both queries perform similar calculations for the percentage, using equivalent counts in the numerator and denominator.\n\n### Step 6: Check for Logical Equivalence in Conditional Expressions\n\n- The conditional expressions used in both queries are logically equivalent.\n\n### Step 7: Assess Ordering of Results\n\n- There is no `ORDER BY` clause in either query, so result ordering does not affect equivalence.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe two queries are logically equivalent given the schema conditions and query logic. We can create a new equivalence rule to reflect this:\n\n<New Rule>\nEquivalent Queries:\nSELECT CAST(COUNT(CASE WHEN T1.col1 = 'value' THEN T1.col1 ELSE NULL END) AS REAL) * 100 / COUNT(T1.col1) FROM table1 AS T1 INNER JOIN table2 AS T2 ON T1.fk_col = T2.pk_col WHERE T2.col2 = 'value';\nSELECT CAST(SUM(CASE WHEN table1.col1 = 'value' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS REAL) * 100 / COUNT(table1.pk_col) FROM table1 INNER JOIN table2 ON table1.fk_col = table2.pk_col WHERE table2.col2 = 'value';\nSchema Conditions:\ntable1.pk_col is a primary key, and table1.fk_col is a foreign key referencing table2.pk_col.\n", role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None, refusal=None))], created=1730780503, model='gpt-4o-2024-08-06', object='chat.completion', system_fingerprint='fp_45cf54deae', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=898, prompt_tokens=3175, total_tokens=4073, prompt_tokens_details={'cached_tokens': 0}, completion_tokens_details={'reasoning_tokens': 0, 'accepted_prediction_tokens': 0, 'rejected_prediction_tokens': 0}))

1. Understand the Database Schema: Identify all tables used in both queries. List all columns referenced, along with their data types and constraints. Determine primary and foreign key relationships. Note any indexes or unique constraints that may affect query execution.
2. Parse and Break Down Each Query: Identify selected columns, functions, and expressions. Note the tables involved and the join conditions. Understand the filtering conditions applied. Identify grouping and aggregate conditions, if any. Determine if result ordering affects equivalence.
3. Compare Query Components: Check if both queries use the same tables and join conditions. Compare filtering conditions in the WHERE clauses. Assess whether the same columns and expressions are selected. Identify if different functions or syntaxes achieve the same result. Look for logical equivalence in expressions and calculations.
4. Consider Edge Cases and Data Variations: Conceptualize sample datasets that include edge cases (e.g., NULL values, zero values, special characters). Analyze how each query handles these edge cases. Ensure that data type differences do not affect the outcome. Verify that constraints (e.g., NOT NULL, UNIQUE) are accounted for.
5. Evaluate Aggregations and Calculations: Confirm that aggregate functions (e.g., SUM, COUNT) are applied identically. Ensure calculations (e.g., subtraction, addition) produce the same results.
6. Check for Logical Equivalence in Conditional Expressions: Compare conditional expressions like IIF, CASE WHEN, and IF. Determine if conditions and returned values are logically the same.
7. Assess Ordering of Results: If ORDER BY clause is present, confirm that both queries order results identically. Recognize that differing order may affect equivalence if result order is significant.
8. Generate a New Logical Equivalence Rule (If Applicable): Create an "Equivalent Queries: <query1>
<query2>
Schema Conditions:<conditions>" statement that defines the equivalence. Use GENERALIZED COLUMN and TABLE NAMES. Specify any necessary conditions based on the database schema. Present the rule clearly, indicating both the equivalence and the conditions under which it holds.

# Guidelines:
- Make SURE complete to every step PERFECTLY without ANY Mistakes
- Follow the Rules I Gave you and Remember to AVOID generating repeated equivalence rules in the examples I gave you.
- Be sure to format your response like the example equivalence rules I gave you.
- Put <New Rule></New Rule> around the new equivalence rule that you think of. Do not use other formatting around the equivalent queries.
- Use GENERALIZED COLUMN AND TABLE NAMES in any EQUIVALENCE RULE YOU WRITE. DO NOT USE THE SAME NAMES IN THE PROVIDED QUERY PAIRS!!!!
- If the two queries are not logically equivalent, say <New Rule> Not equivalent </New Rule>.
- If the new equivalence rule is already repeated in the examples listed, say <New Rule> Rule exists </New Rule>.
- The new rule should be be MINIMAL to CLEARLY demonstrate the highlighted semantic difference. Use ellipses to shorten SQL queries where necessary to achieve this.

Take a Deep Breath and Carefully Follow the Rules, Guides and Examples I gave you. I will tip you $2000 if you do EVERYTHING Perfectly.

# Guidelines:
- Make SURE complete to every step PERFECTLY without ANY Mistakes
- Follow the Rules I Gave you and Remember to AVOID generating repeated equivalence rules in the examples I gave you.
- Be sure to format your response like the example equivalence rules I gave you.
- Put <New Rule></New Rule> around the new equivalence rule that you think of. Do not use other formatting around the equivalent queries.
- Use GENERALIZED COLUMN AND TABLE NAMES in any EQUIVALENCE RULE YOU WRITE. DO NOT USE THE SAME NAMES IN THE PROVIDED QUERY PAIRS!!!!
- If the two queries are not logically equivalent, say <New Rule> Not equivalent </New Rule>.
- If the new equivalence rule is already repeated in the examples listed, say <New Rule> Rule exists </New Rule>.
- The new rule should be be MINIMAL to CLEARLY demonstrate the highlighted semantic difference. Use ellipses to shorten SQL queries where necessary to achieve this.

Take a Deep Breath and Carefully Follow the Rules, Guides and Examples I gave you. I will tip you $2000 if you do EVERYTHING Perfectly.

Understand the Database Schema:\n\n**Tables and Columns:**\n- `molecule`: `molecule_id` (TEXT, Primary Key), `label` (TEXT)\n- `atom`: `atom_id` (TEXT, Primary Key), `molecule_id` (TEXT, Foreign Key referencing `molecule.molecule_id`), `element` (TEXT)\n- `bond`: `bond_id` (TEXT, Primary Key), `molecule_id` (TEXT, Foreign Key referencing `molecule.molecule_id`), `bond_type` (TEXT)\n- `connected`: `atom_id` (TEXT, Primary Key), `atom_id2` (TEXT, Primary Key), `bond_id` (TEXT, Foreign Key referencing `bond.bond_id`)\n\n### 2. Parse and Break Down Each Query:\n\n**Gold SQL Query:**\n- Selects `molecule_id` from a subquery.\n- Subquery performs an `INNER JOIN` on `molecule` and `atom` tables.\n- Filters with `WHERE` condition `molecule.label = '-'`.\n- Groups by `molecule_id` and applies `HAVING` condition `COUNT(atom_id) > 5`.\n\n**Machine-generated SQL Query:**\n- Directly selects `molecule_id` from `molecule`.\n- Performs an `INNER JOIN` with `atom`.\n- Filters with `WHERE` condition `molecule.label = '-'`.\n- Groups by `molecule_id` and applies `HAVING` condition `COUNT(atom_id) > 5`.\n\n### 3. Compare Query Components:\n\n- Both queries use the same tables (`molecule` and `atom`) and join conditions.\n- Both queries apply the same filtering (`molecule.label = '-'`).\n- Both queries select the same column (`molecule_id`) and apply the same grouping and `HAVING` condition.\n\n### 4. Consider Edge Cases and Data Variations:\n\n- Both queries handle the same edge cases, such as `NULL` values in `molecule_id` or `atom_id`, since `atom_id` is a primary key and cannot be `NULL`.\n- The `HAVING` condition ensures that only molecules with more than 5 atoms are considered.\n\n### 5. Evaluate Aggregations and Calculations:\n\n- Both queries use `COUNT(atom_id)` in the `HAVING` clause, ensuring the same logical aggregation.\n\n### 6. Check for Logical Equivalence in Conditional Expressions:\n\n- Both queries use the same logical condition in the `HAVING` clause.\n\n### 7. Assess Ordering of Results:\n\n- There is no `ORDER BY` clause in either query, so ordering is not a factor.\n\n### 8. Generate a New Logical Equivalence Rule (If Applicable):\n\nThe two queries are logically equivalent. The gold query uses a subquery to achieve the same result as the direct query in the machine-generated SQL. This is a common pattern where the subquery is unnecessary for the logical outcome. \n\nGiven the analysis, the equivalence rule is:\n\n<New Rule>\nEquivalent Queries:\nSELECT T1.col1 FROM (SELECT T2.col1, COUNT(T3.col2) FROM table1 AS T2 INNER JOIN table2 AS T3 ON T2.col1 = T3.col1 WHERE T2.col3 = 'value' GROUP BY T2.col1 HAVING COUNT(T3.col2) > n) AS T1;\nSELECT table1.col1 FROM table1 INNER JOIN table2 ON table1.col1 = table2.col1 WHERE table1.col3 = 'value' GROUP BY table1.col1 HAVING COUNT(table2.col2) > n;\nSchema Conditions:\ntable2.col1 is a foreign key referencing table1.col1, and table1.col1 is a primary key.\n", role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None, refusal=None))], created=1730780748, model='gpt-4o-2024-08-06', object='chat.completion', system_fingerprint='fp_45cf54deae', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=795, prompt_tokens=3170, total_tokens=3965, prompt_tokens_details={'cached_tokens': 0}, completion_tokens_details={'reasoning_tokens': 0, 'accepted_prediction_tokens': 0, 'rejected_prediction_tokens': 0}))

INFO:root:model: gpt-4o
INFO:root:prompt: You are an expert SQL engineer with 20+ years of experience. You will be given some SQL equivalence rules conditional on some database schemas. You will then be given a pair of SQL queries, consisting of a gold query and a machine-generated query, and a database schema that defines the context of the queries. 

Your task is to compare the two provided SQL queries on logical equivalence and generate one more equivalence rule in the same format as the provided example equivalence rules.

Please make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please also keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.



Evaluation Criteria:

Logical equivalence - the alignment between the gold SQL query and the machine-generated SQL query. A machine-generated SQL query is logically equivalent to the gold query if these two queries would RETURN THE SAME RESULTS AND IN THE SAME ORDER for ALL POSSIBLE DATABASE INSTANCES that satisfy the provided database schema for these queries. Annotators were asked to penalize machine-generated queries that overlooked edge cases that the gold queries would have caught otherwise.



Evaluation steps:

1. Understand the Database Schema: Identify all tables used in both queries. List all columns referenced, along with their data types and constraints. Determine primary and foreign key relationships. Note any indexes or unique constraints that may affect query execution.
2. Parse and Break Down Each Query: Identify selected columns, functions, and expressions. Note the tables involved and the join conditions. Understand the filtering conditions applied. Identify grouping and aggregate conditions, if any. Determine if result ordering affects equivalence.
3. Compare Query Components: Check if both queries use the same tables and join conditions. Compare filtering conditions in the WHERE clauses. Assess whether the same columns and expressions are selected. Identify if different functions or syntaxes achieve the same result. Look for logical equivalence in expressions and calculations.
4. Consider Edge Cases and Data Variations: Conceptualize sample datasets that include edge cases (e.g., NULL values, zero values, special characters). Analyze how each query handles these edge cases. Ensure that data type differences do not affect the outcome. Verify that constraints (e.g., NOT NULL, UNIQUE) are accounted for.
5. Evaluate Aggregations and Calculations: Confirm that aggregate functions (e.g., SUM, COUNT) are applied identically. Ensure calculations (e.g., subtraction, addition) produce the same results.
6. Check for Logical Equivalence in Conditional Expressions: Compare conditional expressions like IIF, CASE WHEN, and IF. Determine if conditions and returned values are logically the same.
7. Assess Ordering of Results: If ORDER BY clause is present, confirm that both queries order results identically. Recognize that differing order may affect equivalence if result order is significant.
8. Generate a New Logical Equivalence Rule (If Applicable): Create an "Equivalent Queries: <query1>
<query2>
Schema Conditions:<conditions>" statement that defines the equivalence. Use GENERALIZED COLUMN and TABLE NAMES. Specify any necessary conditions based on the database schema. Present the rule clearly, indicating both the equivalence and the conditions under which it holds.

Equivalent Queries:
SELECT column_name FROM table_name WHERE SUBSTR(date_column, 1, 7) = 'YYYY-MM';

# Guidelines:
- Make SURE complete to every step PERFECTLY without ANY Mistakes
- Follow the Rules I Gave you and Remember to AVOID generating repeated equivalence rules in the examples I gave you.
- Be sure to format your response like the example equivalence rules I gave you.
- Put <New Rule></New Rule> around the new equivalence rule that you think of. Do not use other formatting around the equivalent queries.
- Use GENERALIZED COLUMN AND TABLE NAMES in any EQUIVALENCE RULE YOU WRITE. DO NOT USE THE SAME NAMES IN THE PROVIDED QUERY PAIRS!!!!
- If the two queries are not logically equivalent, say <New Rule> Not equivalent </New Rule>.
- If the new equivalence rule is already repeated in the examples listed, say <New Rule> Rule exists </New Rule>.
- The new rule should be be MINIMAL to CLEARLY demonstrate the highlighted semantic difference. Use ellipses to shorten SQL queries where necessary to achieve this.

Take a Deep Breath and Carefully Follow the Rules, Guides and Examples I gave you. I will tip you $2000 if you do EVERYTHING Perfectly.

INFO:root:model: gpt-4o
INFO:root:prompt: You are an expert SQL engineer with 20+ years of experience. You will be given some SQL equivalence rules conditional on some database schemas. You will then be given a pair of SQL queries, consisting of a gold query and a machine-generated query, and a database schema that defines the context of the queries. 

Your task is to compare the two provided SQL queries on logical equivalence and generate one more equivalence rule in the same format as the provided example equivalence rules.

Please make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please also keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.



Evaluation Criteria:

Logical equivalence - the alignment between the gold SQL query and the machine-generated SQL query. A machine-generated SQL query is logically equivalent to the gold query if these two queries would RETURN THE SAME RESULTS AND IN THE SAME ORDER for ALL POSSIBLE DATABASE INSTANCES that satisfy the provided database schema for these queries. Annotators were asked to penalize machine-generated queries that overlooked edge cases that the gold queries would have caught otherwise.



Evaluation steps:

1. Understand the Database Schema: Identify all tables used in both queries. List all columns referenced, along with their data types and constraints. Determine primary and foreign key relationships. Note any indexes or unique constraints that may affect query execution.
2. Parse and Break Down Each Query: Identify selected columns, functions, and expressions. Note the tables involved and the join conditions. Understand the filtering conditions applied. Identify grouping and aggregate conditions, if any. Determine if result ordering affects equivalence.
3. Compare Query Components: Check if both queries use the same tables and join conditions. Compare filtering conditions in the WHERE clauses. Assess whether the same columns and expressions are selected. Identify if different functions or syntaxes achieve the same result. Look for logical equivalence in expressions and calculations.
4. Consider Edge Cases and Data Variations: Conceptualize sample datasets that include edge cases (e.g., NULL values, zero values, special characters). Analyze how each query handles these edge cases. Ensure that data type differences do not affect the outcome. Verify that constraints (e.g., NOT NULL, UNIQUE) are accounted for.
5. Evaluate Aggregations and Calculations: Confirm that aggregate functions (e.g., SUM, COUNT) are applied identically. Ensure calculations (e.g., subtraction, addition) produce the same results.
6. Check for Logical Equivalence in Conditional Expressions: Compare conditional expressions like IIF, CASE WHEN, and IF. Determine if conditions and returned values are logically the same.
7. Assess Ordering of Results: If ORDER BY clause is present, confirm that both queries order results identically. Recognize that differing order may affect equivalence if result order is significant.
8. Generate a New Logical Equivalence Rule (If Applicable): Create an "Equivalent Queries: <query1>
<query2>
Schema Conditions:<conditions>" statement that defines the equivalence. Use GENERALIZED COLUMN and TABLE NAMES. Specify any necessary conditions based on the database schema. Present the rule clearly, indicating both the equivalence and the conditions under which it holds.

# Guidelines:
- Make SURE complete to every step PERFECTLY without ANY Mistakes
- Follow the Rules I Gave you and Remember to AVOID generating repeated equivalence rules in the examples I gave you.
- Be sure to format your response like the example equivalence rules I gave you.
- Put <New Rule></New Rule> around the new equivalence rule that you think of. Do not use other formatting around the equivalent queries.
- Use GENERALIZED COLUMN AND TABLE NAMES in any EQUIVALENCE RULE YOU WRITE. DO NOT USE THE SAME NAMES IN THE PROVIDED QUERY PAIRS!!!!
- If the two queries are not logically equivalent, say <New Rule> Not equivalent </New Rule>.
- If the new equivalence rule is already repeated in the examples listed, say <New Rule> Rule exists </New Rule>.
- The new rule should be be MINIMAL to CLEARLY demonstrate the highlighted semantic difference. Use ellipses to shorten SQL queries where necessary to achieve this.

Take a Deep Breath and Carefully Follow the Rules, Guides and Examples I gave you. I will tip you $2000 if you do EVERYTHING Perfectly.
