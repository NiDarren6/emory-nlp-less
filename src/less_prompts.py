    You are an expert SQL engineer with 20+ years of experience. You will be given some SQL equivalence rules conditional on some database schemas. You will then be given a pair of SQL queries, consisting of a gold query and a machine-generated query, and a database schema that defines the context of the queries. 

    Your task is to compare the two provided SQL queries on logical equivalence and generate one more equivalence rule in the same format as the provided example equivalence rules.

    Please make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please also keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.


    Evaluation Criteria:

    Logical equivalence - the alignment between the gold SQL query and the machine-generated SQL query. A machine-generated SQL query is logically equivalent to the gold query if these two queries would RETURN THE SAME RESULTS AND IN THE SAME ORDER for ALL POSSIBLE DATABASE INSTANCES that satisfy the provided database schema for these queries. Annotators were asked to penalize machine-generated queries that overlooked edge cases that the gold queries would have caught otherwise.


    Evaluation steps:

    1. Understand the Database Schema: Identify all tables used in both queries. List all columns referenced, along with their data types and constraints. Determine primary and foreign key relationships. Note any indexes or unique constraints that may affect query execution.
    2. Parse and Break Down Each Query: Identify selected columns, functions, and expressions. Note the tables involved and the join conditions. Understand the filtering conditions applied. Identify grouping and aggregate conditions, if any. Determine if result ordering affects equivalence.
    3. Compare Query Components: Check if both queries use the same tables and join conditions. Compare filtering conditions in the WHERE clauses. Assess whether the same columns and expressions are selected. Identify if different functions or syntaxes achieve the same result. Look for logical equivalence in expressions and calculations.
    4. Consider Edge Cases and Data Variations: Conceptualize sample datasets that include edge cases (e.g., NULL values, zero values, special characters). Analyze how each query handles these edge cases. Ensure that data type differences do not affect the outcome. Verify that constraints (e.g., NOT NULL, UNIQUE) are accounted for.
    5. Evaluate Aggregations and Calculations: Confirm that aggregate functions (e.g., SUM, COUNT) are applied identically. Ensure calculations (e.g., subtraction, addition) produce the same results.
    6. Check for Logical Equivalence in Conditional Expressions: Compare conditional expressions like IIF, CASE WHEN, and IF. Determine if conditions and returned values are logically the same.
    7. Assess Ordering of Results: If ORDER BY clause is present, confirm that both queries order results identically. Recognize that differing order may affect equivalence if result order is significant.
    8. Generate a New Logical Equivalence Rule (If Applicable): Create an "If <condition> then, <clause 1> â‰¡ <clause 2>" statement that defines the equivalence. Specify any necessary conditions based on the database schema. Present the rule clearly, indicating both the equivalence and the conditions under which it holds.


    Example Equivalence Rules:
    {esmp_rules}
    {new_rules}

    # Guidelines:
    - Make SURE complete to every step PERFECTLY without ANY Mistakes
    - Follow the Rules I Gave you and Remember to AVOID generating repeated equivalence rules in the examples I gave you.
